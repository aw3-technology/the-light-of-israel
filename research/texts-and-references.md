## Key Passages to Feature

- Let texts dialogue with each other, not dominate narrative

## The Central Metaphor
All these texts are attempting to capture and transmit light — some successfully (sacred texts), some distorting it (ideologies), some inverting it entirely (Protocols). Eden's journey is learning to distinguish true light from false, and ultimately to carry authentic light forward.
