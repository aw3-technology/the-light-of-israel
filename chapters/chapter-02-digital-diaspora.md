# Chapter 2: Digital Diaspora

Ethan had been swiping for forty-five minutes and couldn’t recall a single face.

Left, left, left, right, left—Brooklyn dusk bleeding orange through his window while profiles blurred past. Yoga poses at sunset, founders on summits, the same declarations about adventures and lazy Sundays. Sarah had called him "emotionally absent" eight months ago. She was right; knowing hadn't made him any more present.

Rachel Klein would be his thirty-seventh first date since Sarah. Her message had cut through the noise: "Your bio says you optimize user journeys. Can you optimize this awkward opening message?" Direct. Funny enough. Wednesday evening date—low stakes, easy exit.

Before his bathroom mirror: dark jeans, navy button-down. Sarah had called it his dating uniform, said it brought out his eyes—"beautifully vacant."

A face calibrated for competence, tuned low for anything else. Somewhere in that face was Ethan Israel Stone, but tonight he'd be just Ethan—product manager, Brooklyn resident, the kind of Jewish that meant knowing about bagels and anxiety but nothing about why his grandmother had covered her eyes when lighting candles, whispering prayers that made their cramped apartment expand into something infinite.

Three days until her yahrzeit. He hadn't lit a candle last year.
The yahrzeit candle sat in the junk drawer beside spare batteries and orphaned keys.

The Uber driver's name was Abraham.

"Going somewhere nice?" Abraham asked, accent carrying warmth from somewhere Ethan had never visited. He was humming, unselfconscious, a melody Ethan couldn't place.

"Just meeting someone."

"Ah." Abraham's eyes found his in the mirror. "You'll find what you're looking for, my friend. Sometimes not where you expect."

The ride took seventeen minutes. Long enough to skim Rachel's profile again, rehearsing opening lines. Short enough to avoid real conversation with Abraham, who kept glancing at him in the mirror with knowing eyes. Marketing at a wellness startup, Northwestern, Fort Greene. In her photos she held wine glasses at gallery openings where the lighting was always golden hour.

Three couples exited as he arrived. Perfect timing.

Rachel sat in the second booth, exactly like her photos. A small scar above her left eyebrow that her fingers kept finding.

Brief embrace. He could feel her nervousness, the way she held herself back. Bergamot and something sharper.

"You made it through Brooklyn traffic."

"Not too bad." She'd taken the seat facing out; it felt to Ethan like she was scanning the door for a better option—probably just his projection.

Rachel ordered orange wine before he'd opened the menu. "Trust me," she said, fingers grazing his wrist. "It's having a moment."

"So tell me about optimizing user journeys," she said, leaning forward. "Your profile made it sound almost—" she searched—"interesting."

He noticed her speech pattern—slight uptick at sentence ends, California influence over East Coast roots—and found himself unconsciously matching it.

"I figure out why people abandon their shopping carts."

"Late capitalism's hero." Her laugh was surprisingly loud, unguarded. She covered her mouth, embarrassed. "Sorry, I—" a small snort—"when I actually laugh."

"Don't apologize. It's the first real thing I've heard all week."

"Real is dangerous on first dates."

The wine arrived—orange, cloudy. They toasted Wednesday night in Brooklyn. It tasted like apricot and stone dust, a faint bitterness.

"So, Ethan."

"My parents were going through a phase."

"My parents named me after my great-grandmother. She escaped Poland in '39, last boat out of Gdańsk." Rachel's fingers found the scar again. "Twenty years old, everything in one suitcase, your entire family waving goodbye forever. She kept sugar cubes wrapped in tissue for tea. Said the sweetness reminded her that life could still be good."

Something tightened in Ethan's chest.

"Must have been terrifying," he said.

"Maybe. But she was tougher than she looked." Rachel's voice went harder. "Outlived three husbands, raised six kids, died at ninety-eight cursing in Polish. She wasn't a victim."

The edge in her tone surprised him. "I didn't mean—"

"People always do. The Holocaust story, the survivor narrative." She took a long sip of wine. "Like that's all we are. Trauma inheritors."

The moment hung between them, fragile as blown glass.

"We wanted different things."

"Translation: she wanted you to feel something."

The accuracy stung. He opened his mouth to say something real—about his grandmother dying alone, about the prayers he'd never learned, about feeling like a tourist in his own life. Instead: "What about you?"

"He moved to San Francisco for a startup. Said I was—" She stopped. "Actually, no. I'm not doing this."

"Doing what?"

"The mutual confessional. Where we bond over our damage." She leaned back. "I was the problem, he was the problem, we were both problems. End scene."

"Want to know something?" Rachel said, wine loosening her tongue. "I've been on probably fifty first dates this year. They all—" She laughed, but it came out bitter. "God, fifty. That's pathetic."

"Same conversations?"

"Same nothing. Like we're all—" She stopped, gestured vaguely. "I don't know what we're doing."

"Digital diaspora," he said without thinking. The phrase felt right—all these profiles scattered across apps like his ancestors across continents, everyone searching for connection but finding only distance measured in swipes.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just... wandering."

Rachel studied him with new interest. "My grandmother used to say we were all in exile until we found our way home. Never knew what she meant." Bitter laugh. "Probably Israel."

Ethan's grandmother had said the same thing. Had died saying it. The words hung between them, heavy with possibility.

"Anyway." Rachel reached for her wine. "That's enough family trauma for one appetizer course."

They ordered another round instead of dessert. The conversation drifted through safe waters—work, Netflix, the eternal New York question of neighborhood loyalty. Rachel photographed their food, posted immediately, the blue light of her phone reflecting in her wine glass.

"What time is it?" Rachel asked.

"Nine-fifteen."

He thought about leaning across the table and decided against it, letting the gap between them do the talking.

"This is nice," Rachel said, pulling back.

He felt her pulling away emotionally before she moved physically—that subtle energetic shift he always caught, the precursor to goodbye.

"It is."

The check arrived on its little silver tray. Ethan reached for it automatically; Rachel did the wallet dance. Outside, October air carried hints of burning leaves.

"I had a good time," Rachel said, her smile syncing to his.

Another kiss—brief, final. The Uber ride back: careful space between them, her face lit by her phone screen as she checked messages, already back in the app.

"This is me." A brownstone like every other. Another kiss, lighter than air. "Text me?"

"Definitely."

He watched through her window as she disappeared upstairs, saw the blue glow of her phone screen, thumb already swiping. The same carousel they'd both just performed in person.

Back home, Ethan's thumb hovered over his phone. He typed to Rachel: "Thank you for listening about my grandmother." Hit send before he could delete it.

His mother had texted: "Three days until Grandma's yahrzeit. Will you light a candle this year?" He typed, "I will," watched the gray dots pulse, then held backspace until the promise disappeared.

He opened the dating app. The same faces, rearranged. His thumb moved automatically—left, left, right—then stopped.

October 7th. The yahrzeit his grandmother had observed for her parents, that his parents had observed for her, that waited now for him. He lifted the candle from the junk drawer, set it on the kitchen counter where streetlight caught the white wax.

This time, he left it there.

His phone buzzed—Rachel texting back. He didn't look. Tomorrow he might swipe again, might continue the endless carousel. Tonight, the candle waited on his counter like a small, stubborn promise he wasn't ready to break.
