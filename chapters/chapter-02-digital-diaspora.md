# Chapter 2: Digital Diaspora

Ethan had been swiping for forty-five minutes and couldn’t recall a single face.

Left, left, left, right, left—Brooklyn dusk bleeding orange through his window while profiles blurred past. Yoga poses at sunset, founders on summits, the same declarations about adventures and lazy Sundays. Sarah had called him "emotionally absent" eight months ago. She was right; knowing hadn't made him any more present.

Rachel Klein would be his thirty-seventh first date since Sarah. Her message had cut through the noise: "Your bio says you optimize user journeys. Can you optimize this awkward opening message?" Direct. Funny enough. Wednesday evening date—low stakes, easy exit.

Before his bathroom mirror: dark jeans, navy button-down. Sarah had called it his dating uniform, said it brought out his eyes—"beautifully vacant."

A face calibrated for competence, tuned low for anything else. Somewhere in that face was Ethan Israel Stone, but tonight he'd be just Ethan—product manager, Brooklyn resident, the kind of Jewish that meant knowing about bagels and anxiety but nothing about why his grandmother had covered her eyes when lighting candles, whispering prayers that made their cramped apartment expand into something infinite.

Three days until her yahrzeit. He hadn't lit a candle last year.
The yahrzeit candle lived in the junk drawer beside spare batteries and orphaned keys, a small cylinder of wax he pretended not to see when hunting for tape.

The Uber driver's name was Abraham. Of course it was. Ethan clocked the coincidence—Abraham, father of nations, on the way to meet Rachel, mother of Israel—then scolded himself for reading patterns into everything lately. Still, the pattern recognition part of his brain filed it away: third Abraham this week, seventh biblical name today.

"Going somewhere nice?" Abraham asked, accent carrying warmth from somewhere Ethan had never visited. He was humming, unselfconscious, a melody Ethan couldn't place.

"Just meeting someone."

"Ah." Abraham's eyes found his in the mirror. "You'll find what you're looking for, my friend. Sometimes not where you expect."

The ride took seventeen minutes. Long enough to skim Rachel's profile again, rehearsing opening lines. Short enough to avoid real conversation with Abraham, who kept glancing at him in the mirror with knowing eyes. Marketing at a wellness startup, Northwestern, Fort Greene. In her photos she held wine glasses at gallery openings where the lighting was always golden hour.

Three couples exited as he arrived. Perfect timing.

Rachel sat in the second booth, exactly like her photos—proof and letdown at once. Highlights catching restaurant light, studied effortlessness. A small scar above her left eyebrow that her fingers kept finding.
From the kitchen: citrus zest releasing under a cook's knife, a thread of garlic, steam carrying orange peel and char.

Brief embrace. Her tension transferred immediately into his shoulders—he could feel her nervousness like a frequency only he could hear. Bergamot and something sharper. Without thinking, he adjusted his posture to mirror hers, lowering his energy to match her anxiety level.

"You made it through Brooklyn traffic."

"Not too bad." She'd taken the seat facing out; it felt to Ethan like she was scanning the door for a better option—probably just his projection.

Rachel ordered orange wine before he'd opened the menu. "Trust me," she said, fingers grazing his wrist. "It's having a moment."

"So tell me about optimizing user journeys," she said, leaning forward. "Your profile made it sound almost—" she searched—"interesting."

He noticed her speech pattern—slight uptick at sentence ends, California influence over East Coast roots—and found himself unconsciously matching it.

"I figure out why people abandon their shopping carts."

"Late capitalism's hero." Her laugh was surprisingly loud, unguarded. She covered her mouth, embarrassed. "Sorry, I—" a small snort—"when I actually laugh."

"Don't apologize. It's the first real thing I've heard all week."

"Real is dangerous on first dates."

The wine arrived—orange, cloudy, from the Golan Heights. The bottle sweated in the warm restaurant air. They toasted Wednesday night in Brooklyn. The wine tasted like apricot and stone dust, a faint bitterness like citrus pith. Around them, plates clattered and conversations overlapped in three languages. The couple at the next table was clearly on a first date too—the same careful choreography of interest and distance.

"So, Ethan—biblical name."

"My parents were going through a phase."

"My parents named me after my great-grandmother. She escaped Poland in '39, last boat out of Gdańsk." Rachel's fingers found the scar again, tracing it like reading braille. "Twenty years old, everything in one suitcase, your entire family waving goodbye forever. She kept sugar cubes wrapped in tissue in her coat for tea, even on the boat. Said the sweetness reminded her that life could still be good."

Something tightened in Ethan's chest. His grandmother had been twenty-two when she left Berlin.

"Mine too," he said suddenly. "My grandmother. Berlin, 1938. She..." The words felt rusty, unused. "She kept her Shabbat candlesticks hidden in a flour sack the whole journey. Lit them every Friday until she died last year."

Rachel's fingers stilled on her scar. "When?"

"October 7th."

"That's in three days."

"I know." He hadn't meant to say any of this. "I haven't lit a candle for her yet. Don't even remember the prayer."

Rachel reached across the table, her fingertips barely grazing his knuckles. "Maybe that's okay. Maybe just lighting it is enough."

The moment hung between them, fragile as blown glass.

"We wanted different things."

"Translation: she wanted you to feel something."

The accuracy stung. "What about you?"

"He moved to San Francisco. Said I was too much and not enough simultaneously." She pulled her sleeves over her hands when she talked, suddenly younger. "Math I'm still trying to solve."

"Want to know something?" Rachel said, wine softening her edges. "I've been on probably fifty first dates this year. They all blur together. Same conversations, same—" She gestured at the space between them.

"Same nothing?"

"Exactly. Like we're all auditioning for roles but nobody knows what the play is. Or even the lines."

"Digital diaspora," he said without thinking. The phrase felt right—all these profiles scattered across apps like his ancestors across continents, everyone searching for connection but finding only distance measured in swipes.

"What?"

He started to explain—how everyone seemed lost in these apps, scattered like diaspora, searching for connection but finding only distance measured in swipes. "Nothing. Just... wandering."

Rachel studied him with new interest. "My grandmother used to say we were all in exile until we found our way home. Never knew what she meant." Bitter laugh. "Probably Israel."

Ethan's grandmother had said the same thing. Had died saying it. The words hung between them, heavy with possibility.

"Anyway." Rachel reached for her wine. "That's enough family trauma for one appetizer course."

They ordered another round instead of dessert. The conversation drifted through safe waters—work, Netflix, the eternal New York question of neighborhood loyalty. Rachel photographed their food, posted immediately, the blue light of her phone reflecting in her wine glass.

"What time is it?" Rachel asked.

"Nine-fifteen."

He thought about leaning across the table and decided against it, letting the gap between them do the talking.

"This is nice," Rachel said, pulling back.

He felt her pulling away emotionally before she moved physically—that subtle energetic shift he always caught, the precursor to goodbye.

"It is."

The check arrived on its little silver tray. Ethan reached for it automatically; Rachel did the wallet dance. Outside, October air carried hints of burning leaves and somewhere, distant singing—definitely from the Chabad house down the block, the melody familiar but unplaceable, something his grandmother might have hummed.

"I had a good time," Rachel said, her smile syncing to his.

Another kiss—brief, final. The Uber ride back: careful space between them, her face lit by her phone screen as she checked messages, already back in the app.

"This is me." A brownstone like every other. Another kiss, lighter than air. "Text me?"

"Definitely."

He watched through her window as she disappeared upstairs, saw the blue glow of her phone screen, thumb already swiping. The same carousel they'd both just performed in person.

Back home, Ethan's thumb hovered over his phone. He could text Rachel now, continue what had started when he'd finally spoken about his grandmother. The message typed itself: "Thank you for listening about my grandmother." He hit send before he could delete it.

His mother had texted: "Three days until Grandma's yahrzeit. Will you light a candle this year?" He typed, "I will," watched the gray dots of his own resolve pulse, then held backspace until the promise disappeared.

Rachel's grandmother, last boat from Gdańsk. His grandmother, train from Berlin. Both women carrying prayers their grandchildren wouldn't understand, planting themselves in American soil with nothing but hope and terror. The weight of their survival pressed against his chest, making it hard to breathe.

He opened the dating app. The same faces from this morning, rearranged. His thumb moved automatically—left, left, right, left. Each face a door to the same empty room. He closed it.

But somewhere between swipes, he stopped. Listened to the Chabad house singing drifting through his window. Felt the weight of three days, the yahrzeit candle in the junk drawer, the conversation he'd walked away from.

October 7th. The yahrzeit his grandmother had observed for her parents, that his parents had observed for her, that waited now for him. The candle felt heavier than it should when he lifted it from the drawer—twenty-four hours of light compressed into white wax. He set it on the kitchen counter where it caught the streetlight through his window, then, embarrassed by its sudden significance, slid it back into darkness.

Tomorrow he'd swipe again. Tonight, he sat in the space between forgetting and remembering, between the person he'd pretended to be and the person he'd never learned to become.
