# Chapter 1: The Hollow Morning

Ethan Stone woke to his phone alarm at 7:18 AM and wondered, not for the first time, if this was what dying felt like—breathing but not living, moving but not going anywhere. His surname had never felt more accurate: Stone. Heavy, immovable, going nowhere. The notification sound from Slack pulled him from dreams he couldn't remember into a Tuesday morning that would be indistinguishable from Monday, from last Tuesday, from the endless procession of gray late September days that made up his thirty-third year in 2023.

He checked his phone before his feet touched the floor. Seventeen notifications. No one calling his name. Josh from engineering: "hey can you check the Mixpanel funnel for yesterday's release?" Maya from design: "v3 wireframes for the Spotify integration ready for review." A calendar reminder for the 9:30 standup where they'd discuss metrics that measured engagement without asking engagement with what.

The coffee maker had been programmed the night before—another optimization in a life built on efficiencies that somehow produced no actual results. Ethiopian single origin from Blue Bottle. $18 a bag. He drank it because caffeine was fuel and fuel kept the machine running, even when the machine had forgotten what it was supposed to do. The smell should have been rich, earthy, alive. Instead it registered as brown liquid.

Ethan's apartment reflected his internal architecture: expensive minimalism masking the fact that nothing inside had been chosen with love. The Herman Miller Aeron chair he adjusted to the exact same position every morning—muscle memory of optimization that no longer served a purpose. The pristine kitchen island he never cooked on. The bedroom that felt more like a hotel room—clean, efficient, impersonal. On the bookshelf, barely visible behind design manuals, sat his grandmother's brass candlesticks, tarnished from a year of neglect.

He caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror and looked away immediately. Stubble that needed attention. Eyes that held no curiosity about what the day might bring. His father's jawline, his mother's cheekbones, and something harder to name that came from his grandmother—a weight around the eyes that suggested knowledge of older sorrows. Stone eyes in a Stone face, carrying the weight of foundations that had forgotten what they were supposed to support.

The shower lasted exactly eighteen minutes—he'd timed it once, though he couldn't remember why eighteen had become his standard. The water was hot enough to fog the mirrors, creating a blessed absence of reflection. Steam rose like prayers he'd forgotten how to say, and for a moment the flowing water reminded him of something—his grandmother teaching him to wash his hands before Friday night dinner, pouring water three times over each hand while whispering "Netilat yadayim" in a voice that made the ordinary feel sacred. He stood under the spray and tried to remember the last time he'd felt genuinely excited about anything. The promotion six months ago? Maybe. Though that had felt more like relief than joy—one more rung on a ladder that seemed to lead only to more climbing.

His phone buzzed against the marble countertop. Three missed calls from "Mom." He dismissed the notifications without listening to the voicemails. Whatever guilt or concern or family obligation she wanted to transmit could wait. Everything could wait.

The fourth call came as he was drying his hair. Ethan stared at "Mom" flashing on the screen, thumb hovering over decline. On the sixth ring, muscle memory answered.

"Ethan? Finally. I was starting to worry."

"I'm fine, Mom. Just getting ready for work."

"You sound tired. Are you eating enough? Sleeping?"

The questions felt like stones thrown across an ocean—each one sinking before reaching him. "I'm eating. I'm sleeping."

"Your father thinks we should visit next month. Maybe take you to dinner somewhere nice."

"I'm busy with a product launch."

"Ethan." His mother's voice carried the particular weight mothers use when they're about to say something important. "You haven't been the same since Sarah. It's been eight months. Maybe it's time to—"

"I have to go, Mom."

The phone died at exactly eight minutes and forty-one seconds into the call. Ethan stared at the black screen, feeling something he couldn't name. He'd been on Wellbutrin for two years now, since the promotion that was supposed to make him happy instead made him realize happiness wasn't a metrics-driven outcome.

"Ethan." Her voice softened. "It's been almost a year since Grandma Rivka passed. The yahrzeit is coming up. I thought... maybe we could light a candle together. Video call or something."

His mother paused, and he could hear her breathing, choosing her words. "Just... remember her. She would have wanted—"

"I have to go."

He hung up and immediately regretted it. The phone sat silent on the counter, accusatory as any mirror. September 30th. Almost one year since the woman who'd spoken to him in Yiddish and Hebrew died, taking with her the last thread connecting him to something older than his own understanding.

The commute was a meditation in purposelessness. Subway car packed with people who looked exactly like him—educated, employed, empty. Everyone staring at screens, scrolling through headlines about tensions in the Middle East, Gaza crisis entering day thirty-six, news Ethan scrolled past without absorbing. An Orthodox family got on at 14th Street, the father's prayer fringes visible beneath his white shirt, the children switching between Hebrew and English like Ethan had once done with his grandmother. Ethan felt nothing looking at them, which surprised him. Shouldn't he feel something? Some connection to whatever they represented?

At Union Square, a homeless man with wild gray hair pointed directly at Ethan through the window. "Israel!" he shouted as the train pulled away. "Wake up!" Ethan assumed the man was schizophrenic, talking to voices, but something about the urgency made his stomach tighten.

He stopped at Ali's corner bodega near his office in Flatiron for his usual coffee. "$7.18," said the elderly Yemeni owner, the same price as always. Ethan handed over exact change, never noticing how the number seemed to follow him—his wake-up time, his coffee price, the strange synchronicity of digits that would have meant something to his grandmother. "Have blessed day, brother," the owner said, and Ethan nodded without hearing the words or recognizing the blessing being offered.

His work badge read "Ethan Stone, Senior Product Manager." No middle name. He'd stopped using "Israel" sometime in college, when introducing himself as "Ethan Israel Stone" felt like carrying a flag for a country he'd never visited and a tradition he'd never understood. Now it was just Ethan Stone, which sounded clean, professional, uncomplicated. Like a tech startup or a meditation app.

The office building was glass and steel and artificial everything. Filtered air, controlled temperature, lighting designed to maximize productivity while minimizing awareness that there was a world outside with weather and seasons and actual time passing. His desk was on the eighteenth floor with a view of other glass buildings full of other people doing other jobs that probably felt exactly like his. The elevator had stopped at every floor on the way up, including an unusually long pause at the eighteenth—though he never noticed the significance of eighteen, the number that seemed to follow him everywhere.

"Ethan, good morning." Naomi Patel from UX dropped into the chair beside his desk, laptop already open, coffee in hand. "Did you see Josh's email about the conversion funnel optimization?"

"Not yet." He opened his laptop, waited for it to boot, watched his face appear briefly in the black screen before the corporate login screen replaced it. For a moment, seeing his reflection trapped in that black mirror, he didn't recognize the person looking back. The face looked like someone who'd forgotten his own name.

His LinkedIn profile read "Ethan Stone, Senior Product Manager" with 500+ connections, all professional contacts, no real friends. The middle name "Israel" existed nowhere in his digital presence, erased as thoroughly as if it had never been spoken over his crib by a grandmother who'd survived things Ethan couldn't imagine.

The standup meeting was at 9:30, same conference room, same agenda, same faces discussing the same problems with the same solutions that had worked temporarily the last time. Ethan presented his analysis of user engagement metrics, using words like "optimization" and "iteration" and "user journey friction points" while some part of his mind observed that he was speaking a language that had replaced actual human communication.

"The data shows we're retaining users through the onboarding flow," he heard himself say, "but we're seeing drop-off at the value realization stage."

"So they're signing up but not converting to paid?"

"Right. The value proposition isn't clear within the first session."

"What's our hypothesis for improving value realization?"

Ethan pulled up a slide he'd created at 11 PM the night before, a flowchart that reduced human decision-making to colored boxes and arrows. "We think if we surface premium features earlier in the flow, users will understand the product's full potential."

Everyone nodded. Someone said "Makes sense." Someone else said "Let's A/B test it." The meeting moved on to other topics, other metrics, other optimizations. Ethan's mind drifted to a memory he couldn't quite grasp—his grandmother's hands lighting candles, whispering words in a language he'd once known but had forgotten.

By lunch, he'd answered fifty-one emails, attended two more meetings, and updated three different spreadsheets tracking progress on initiatives he couldn't remember caring about. Every number felt arbitrary, meaningless—unlike the numbers his grandmother had whispered in Hebrew during her evening prayers, numbers that seemed to mean something beyond themselves. His phone showed a text from his mother: "Haven't heard from you in weeks. Your grandmother would be disappointed."

The words from his mother's text echoed in his head: "Your grandmother would be disappointed." September 30th. The anniversary approaching like a storm he could see coming but couldn't prepare for.

Rivka Stone. He closed his eyes and could almost smell her kitchen—challah rising, chicken soup simmering, the lingering scent of Shabbat candles that she lit every Friday evening for seventy years. She'd died last September 30th, leaving him feeling like the last thread connecting him to something older than his own understanding had been cut.

For a moment, standing in his sterile office, Ethan felt something crack inside his chest. Not breaking—cracking. Like an egg before hatching, or ice on a frozen pond when spring comes too suddenly. The crack felt dangerous and necessary, filled with the possibility of drowning or breathing for the first time.

He stared at his mother's text, thumb hovering over the keyboard, unable to type a response. What would he say? That he was fine? That work was good? That he was living the American dream their family had sacrificed everything to achieve? All true. All lies.

The afternoon dissolved into more meetings, more emails, more optimizations of systems designed to optimize other systems in an infinite loop of improvement toward no discernible goal. By 6 PM, the office was emptying, conversations shifting to weekend plans, dinner reservations, dates with people who might or might not become relationships worth having.

Ethan sat at his desk after everyone else had left, laptop still open, cursor blinking in an empty email compose window. Outside, the sun was setting behind the glass canyon of SoHo, casting long shadows that made the city look momentarily beautiful, like something worth living in rather than just enduring.

He thought about calling his mother back. About the voicemails he hadn't listened to. About the grandmother whose yahrzeit was coming up—September 30th, which he knew because it was written in his calendar but felt like information about a stranger's life.

Instead, he closed his laptop and gathered his things. The elevator descended from the eighteenth floor like sinking through water, mirrored walls reflecting him from multiple angles until he looked like an infinity of identical tired men in identical expensive clothes carrying identical leather bags home to identical empty apartments. Each floor counted down felt like a stone dropping into an endless well.

On the street, the evening air carried the scent of food trucks and car exhaust and something else—the faintest hint of autumn, of seasons changing, of time passing whether he participated in it or not. He passed 541 West Broadway, the address numbers catching his eye for a moment before he dismissed the strange familiarity. The Hudson River was somewhere to his west, flowing toward the harbor, carrying the city's reflection toward the ocean like scattered light on moving water. Mountains rose beyond the city somewhere, patient and eternal, but Ethan had forgotten how to lift his eyes that high.

The building doorman, Carlos, waved cheerfully as Ethan approached. "Good evening, Mr. Stone! Beautiful night, no?"

"Yeah," Ethan managed, unable to match the man's warmth. "Beautiful."

Carlos held the door with the practiced grace of someone who'd been opening doors for twenty years. "You work too hard, my friend. When's the last time you took a vacation?"

Ethan couldn't remember. He walked to the subway entrance and descended into the underground, into the fluorescent-lit tunnel that would carry him home to Brooklyn, to another eighteen-minute shower, to another programmed coffee maker, to another morning that would begin at 7:18 AM with the same question he couldn't answer:

What was the point?

The train pulled into the station with a rush of hot air and screeching metal. Ethan stepped inside, found a seat, and closed his eyes as Manhattan receded behind him. Tomorrow would be Wednesday. The metrics would still need optimizing. The user journey would still need smoothing. The meetings would still need attending.

But tonight, for reasons he couldn't explain, he found himself googling "September 30" on his phone. Just the date. Just to see what came up. Just to see if the world had anything to say about the day his grandmother died, the day that marked the beginning of his forgetting who he was supposed to be.

The search results were mostly news about other September 30ths, other years, other people's significant dates. Nothing about Rivka Stone, who had lit candles every Friday evening for seventy years and spoke to God in a language Ethan had never learned to read.

He put his phone away and watched Brooklyn approach through the subway car's scratched windows. Somewhere in his apartment, in a closet he rarely opened, was a box of his grandmother's things his parents had given him after the funeral. He'd never looked through it. Never felt ready to discover what she'd thought was worth keeping.

Maybe tonight, he thought. Maybe tonight he'd finally find out what she'd wanted him to remember.

The train pulled into his station at 7:18 PM. He noticed the time and wondered if numbers like that were supposed to mean something, if the universe was trying to tell him something he wasn't smart enough to understand.

Ethan Stone climbed the subway stairs into the Park Slope evening, carrying his emptiness home like a briefcase full of work that would never be finished.

His phone buzzed as he reached street level. 7:19 PM. A text from an unknown number:

*"The light you're looking for is closer than you think. Thursday evening. Congregation Beth Shalom, 7th Avenue. Ask for Rabbi Levi. Your grandmother spoke of you often."*

Ethan stared at the message, reading it three times. Nobody had his number who would know about his grandmother. Nobody knew he was looking for anything, least of all light.

But Rivka Stone had always said that when God wanted your attention, coincidences stopped being coincidental.

Ethan pocketed his phone and walked toward his apartment, but for the first time in months, his steps carried the weight of purpose instead of just the weight of forward motion.
