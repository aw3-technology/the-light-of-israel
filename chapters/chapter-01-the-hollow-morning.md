# Chapter 1: The Hollow Morning

Ethan Stone woke to his phone alarm at 7:18 AM and wondered if this was what dying felt like—breathing but not living, moving but not going anywhere. His surname had never felt more accurate: Stone. Heavy, immovable, sinking.

Seventeen notifications. No one calling his name. Josh from engineering: "hey can you check the Mixpanel funnel?" Maya from design: "v3 wireframes ready." A calendar reminder for the 9:30 standup where they'd discuss metrics that measured engagement without asking engagement with what.

The coffee maker had been programmed the night before—Ethiopian single origin, $18 a bag. He drank it because caffeine kept the machine running, even when the machine had forgotten what it was supposed to produce. The smell should have been rich, alive. Instead: brown liquid.

His apartment reflected his internal architecture: expensive minimalism masking emptiness. The Herman Miller chair adjusted to the exact same position every morning. The pristine kitchen island he never cooked on. On the bookshelf, barely visible behind design manuals, sat his grandmother's brass candlesticks, tarnished from a year of neglect.

He caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror and looked away. Stone eyes in a Stone face, carrying the weight of foundations that had forgotten what they were supposed to support.

The shower lasted exactly eighteen minutes. Steam rose like prayers he'd forgotten how to say. For a moment the water reminded him of his grandmother teaching him netilat yadayim, pouring water three times over each hand while whispering Hebrew that made the ordinary feel sacred.

His phone buzzed. Three missed calls from "Mom." The fourth came as he was drying his hair.

"Ethan? Finally."

"I'm fine, Mom. Getting ready for work."

"You sound tired." The questions felt like stones thrown across an ocean. "Your father thinks we should visit next month."

"I'm busy with a product launch."

"Ethan." Her voice carried that particular maternal weight. "It's been almost a year since Grandma Rivka passed. October 7th—her yahrzeit is coming up. I thought maybe we could light a candle together."

October 7th. The date hit him like cold water. Not September 30th as he'd misremembered. October 7th. One week away.

"I have to go."

He hung up and immediately regretted it. The phone sat silent, accusatory as any mirror.

The commute was a meditation in purposelessness. Subway car packed with people who looked exactly like him—educated, employed, empty. Everyone scrolling through headlines about Middle East tensions, Gaza crisis day thirty-six, news that slid past without penetrating.

An Orthodox family got on at 14th Street, the father's prayer fringes visible, children switching between Hebrew and English like Ethan once had with his grandmother. He felt nothing looking at them. Shouldn't he feel something?

At Union Square, a homeless man with wild gray hair pointed directly at Ethan through the window. "Israel!" he shouted as the train pulled away. "Wake up!"

Ali's corner bodega. "$7.18," said the elderly Yemeni owner. Ethan handed over exact change, never noticing how the number followed him—wake time, coffee price, the strange synchronicity. "Have blessed day, brother," the owner said. Ethan nodded without hearing the blessing.

His work badge read "Ethan Stone, Senior Product Manager." No middle name. He'd stopped using "Israel" in college, when the full name felt like carrying a flag for a country he'd never visited. Now just Ethan Stone—clean, professional, uncomplicated.

The office: eighteenth floor, glass and steel, artificial everything. His desk overlooked other glass buildings full of other people doing other versions of the same nothing.

The standup at 9:30. Same room, same faces, same problems.

"The data shows drop-off at the value realization stage," he heard himself say.

"What's our hypothesis?"

Words like "optimization" and "iteration" while some part of his mind observed that he was speaking a language that had replaced actual human communication.

By lunch: fifty-one emails, three spreadsheets, initiatives he couldn't remember caring about. His phone showed his mother's text: "Your grandmother would be disappointed."

Rivka Stone. He could almost smell her kitchen—challah rising, soup simmering, the lingering scent of Shabbat candles she'd lit every Friday for seventy years. She'd died last October 7th, and with her went the last thread connecting him to something older than his own understanding.

For a moment, standing in his sterile office, Ethan felt something crack inside. Not breaking—cracking. Like an egg before hatching, or ice when spring comes suddenly. The crack felt dangerous and necessary.

By 6 PM, the office emptied. Ethan sat alone, laptop open, cursor blinking in an empty compose window. Outside, the sun set behind SoHo's glass canyon, casting shadows that made the city momentarily beautiful.

The elevator descended from eighteen like sinking through water, mirrors reflecting infinite identical tired men in identical expensive clothes.

On the street, evening air carried food trucks and exhaust and the faintest hint of autumn. He passed 541 West Broadway, the numbers catching his eye before he dismissed the strange familiarity.

The subway home. Brooklyn approaching through scratched windows. Somewhere in his apartment, in a closet he rarely opened, was a box of his grandmother's things. He'd never looked through it.

Maybe tonight.

The train pulled into his station at 7:18 PM. He noticed the time and wondered if numbers were supposed to mean something.

His phone buzzed as he reached street level. 7:19 PM. Unknown number:

*"The light you're looking for is closer than you think. Thursday evening. Congregation Beth Shalom, 7th Avenue. Ask for Rabbi Levi. Your grandmother spoke of you often."*

Ethan stared at the message. Nobody had this number who would know about his grandmother. Nobody knew he was looking for anything, least of all light.

But October 7th was coming. Seven days away. And Rivka Stone had always said that when God wanted your attention, coincidences stopped being coincidental.

Ethan pocketed his phone and walked toward his apartment, but for the first time in months, his steps carried purpose instead of just forward motion.

Thursday was two days away. October 7th was one week away. The numbers were beginning to mean something, even if he couldn't yet read their language.
