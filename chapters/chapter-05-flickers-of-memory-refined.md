# Chapter 5: Flickers of Memory

The smell hit him first—brisket and rosemary and something else, something that had no translation from childhood to now.

Friday morning, September 29th. Court Street hummed with its usual contradictions—a woman in Lululemon arguing about oat milk specifications while a homeless veteran counted change against a Citibike rack. The day before his grandmother's yahrzeit, though Ethan was trying not to think about that as he walked toward the subway.

But then the smell from Rosen's Bakery, unchanged since 1947 according to the sign—that smell reached through thirty-three years and grabbed him by the throat, by the seven-year-old hand that had once held his grandmother's as she led him into this exact shop, though it couldn't be this exact shop, he'd grown up on Long Island, but the smell was exactly the same: challah and childhood and something sacred he'd learned to forget.

*"Ethan Israel, we get the challah for Shabbos."*

Her voice in his mind so clear he turned, expecting to see her, but there was only a Hasidic man in the corner of the coffee shop next door, davening, prayer shawl moving like wings.

His coffee tasted wrong. The barista had drawn a Star of David in the foam—probably meant a leaf. $7.50 for this accident.

The Hasidic man finished his prayer, caught Ethan staring. A brief nod before turning back to his siddur.

Memory: Friday nights, age seven, his grandmother's apartment in Kew Gardens that smelled like chicken soup and furniture polish and Europe. The candles on her dining table, two flames that seemed enormous to his child eyes, her hands circling them three times, covering her face, whispering Hebrew that sounded like singing.

*"Why do you cover your eyes, Grandma?"*

*"To make separate the regular from the holy. When I open, Shabbos is here."*

*"But it's just Friday night."*

*"No, bubbeleh. When we light, it becomes more."*

More. His parents would pick him up an hour later, his mother checking her watch, his father jingling car keys. Friday would become just Friday again.

Borough Hall platform. A busker played klezmer on a broken violin. Two teenagers filmed themselves dancing to it, adding trap beats through a Bluetooth speaker. Nobody else noticed the collision of centuries. 

The train arrived already full. He squeezed in, found himself face to face with an elderly woman, her sleeve riding up as she gripped the pole, revealing numbers tattooed on her forearm—faded blue-black, six digits. She caught him looking. He stood, gestured to his seat. She sat.

*"A dank,"* she said quietly. Thank you in Yiddish.

He nodded, not trusting his voice.

The woman's perfume—violets and age—triggered it: his bar mitzvah. Temple Beth Shalom. Phonetic Hebrew tumbling from his mouth. His grandmother in the front row, crying. Not happy tears.

*"You carry our names forward, Ethan Israel. All of them. The ones who couldn't be here."*

*"It's just a bar mitzvah, Grandma. Everyone has one."*

*"No. Not everyone. You don't know how lucky... Never mind. Dance at your party. Be happy. This is enough."*

But it wasn't enough. He could see that now, standing in the subway, holding the pole where the woman with numbers had held it.

West 4th Street. Bodies shifting. Through the window: gray coat, familiar walk. Not her. Never her. Dead fourteen years this September.

Memory: The fight. He was eleven, had brought home a C in Hebrew school. His grandmother's face—not disappointed but furious.

*"You think this is a game? You think Hebrew is just another subject like geography?"*

She'd slammed her palm on the kitchen table. The challah dough jumped.

*"My father would have given anything—ANYTHING—for you to have this chance to learn. And you sit there with your video games, making mockery?"*

His mother had intervened then, keys jangling. *"Mom, he's just a kid."*

*"So were we all. Just kids."*

The anger had drained from her then, leaving something worse—a terrible tiredness.

Spring Street station. He climbed toward daylight. Behind him, conversation fragments:

*"She's sitting shiva for her mother."*

*"What's shiva?"*

*"Jewish thing. Seven days of mourning."*

The 10 AM standup would start without him.

Broome Street. Synagogue doors open. Men hauling out a bench—wood so old it looked soft. The eternal light flickered.

The Torah scrolls passed through the congregation. Age nine, High Holidays. His grandmother pushing him forward.

*"Touch it, bubbeleh. This is yours too."*

He'd pulled back. The rabbi passed. Her hand loosened.

*"It's okay. Maybe next year."*

Next year: bathroom. Year after: stopped going. Year after: dead.

Memory: Disturbing. Age eight, finding her crying in the bathroom at Thanksgiving. Ugly, body-shaking sobs. She was holding a photograph: three children in matching sailor suits.

*"My brothers. My sister."*

*"Where are they?"*

The look she gave him—empty. Like looking into a room where all the furniture had been removed.

*"Gone. Go play, Ethan."*

He'd backed away. Never asked again. Never saw the photo again.

Outside a Chase bank on Houston Street. A man holding a cardboard sign: "Jewish. Hungry. Today is still today." Davening slightly, sign swaying.

Hebrew singing from somewhere. A food truck—"Moishe's Kosher Tacos"—the owner singing along to Israeli radio while assembling orders. *Hava Nagila* mixed with diesel exhaust and cilantro.

Shanghai, 1941—the candlesticks had been there. She'd told him once, offhand while polishing them. *"These saw more than silver should see."* Now they sat in his closet.

*"These were my mother's. And her mother's. And now..."*

*"Grandma, I don't even light Shabbat candles."*

*"Not now. But someday, maybe. Someone will remember."*

Someone will remember. But no one had. The candlesticks were in his closet, behind shoes he never wore, wrapped in the same yellowed tissue paper.

11:47 AM. Phone buzzing: Marcus from work. "Bro, where are you?"

Great Neck Assisted Living, September 2009. She'd shrunk—not just height but presence.

*"It's just Ethan, Grandma."*

*"Names don't just disappear, Ethan."*

*"I go by Ethan now."*

*"You go. But where?"*

Two weeks later: dead.

Delancey Street. Two Orthodox boys arguing about Pokemon cards.

*"Charizard is obviously stronger."*

*"My zeyde says Pokemon is avodah zarah."*

They noticed Ethan watching, went quiet, hurried past.

The wind carried Hebrew melody, and he realized it was coming from his own throat—he was humming it, had been humming for blocks without noticing.

*"Shabbat shalom, Shabbat sha—"*

Lyrics gone. His grandmother had tried to teach him, Friday after Friday, but he'd been more interested in television.

Home. The door stuck. The Thai container had leaked overnight. Through his window: his neighbor's kid practicing violin. Wrong notes. Starting over.

The closet. Past running shoes worn twice. Past the Patagonia vest every tech worker owned.

The tissue paper crumbled at his touch. The candlesticks inside: tarnished black, one base dented, heavier than memory. They smelled of metal and age and Murphy's oil soap and boiled chicken.

Kitchen counter. He set them next to his Nespresso machine. One wobbled—uneven base. In the overhead light: scratches in the silver. Random damage from decades of Friday nights. Or from the journey: Poland to Shanghai to New York. Hidden in flour sacks, she'd said.

He didn't have candles. His mother's Amazon order wouldn't arrive until Sunday. The yahrzeit would pass unmarked except by this—by holding the candlesticks, by remembering.

Outside: Brooklyn's Friday night beginning. Sirens. Music. Someone rolling a shopping cart with one broken wheel.

The candlesticks caught the last light of day, threw shadows on his wall that looked like Hebrew letters.

From the apartment below: a child's voice. *"Mommy, why do we light candles?"*

*"Because Bubbe did."*

*"But why did Bubbe?"*

Silence. Or an answer too quiet to hear through floors.

Ethan's candlesticks stood empty on his counter. The dented one caught the streetlight, threw a small bright spot on his ceiling. Like the first point of light before creation, when everything was void and without form, when the only choice was whether to begin.
