# Chapter 13: Protests in the Streets

The protest signs read "Never Again" on one side of Columbus Circle and "Free Palestine" on the other, the competing slogans creating a geometry of irreconcilable truths.

Saturday, October 21st, the city different than two weeks ago when he'd stood with candles in Washington Square, though the distance between then and now felt like years, decades, the acceleration of history compressing time into moments that contained too much meaning to process, to bear, to navigate without choosing sides that kept multiplying, dividing, demanding loyalty he didn't know how to give.

He'd come to observe. That's what he told himself walking from the subway at 11:47 AM, the number making him think of Boeing planes, of falling, of crashes both literal and metaphorical, though this crash was happening in slow motion, fast motion, all motions at once as two crowds gathered at opposite ends of the circle, the space between them occupied by police, by cameras, by the weight of narratives that couldn't both be true but somehow were.

The sounds reached him from seven blocks away—competing chants braiding together into discordance that made his teeth ache, his chest tight, his steps slow as he approached what felt like walking into a storm, a war, a reckoning he'd spent thirty-three years avoiding but which had apparently been waiting for him here, at this intersection where Broadway met itself coming and going.

Police presence: thirty-six officers that he could count, more arriving, the number significant though he couldn't say why, only that everything had become numerology now, patterns seeking meaning in mathematics because words had failed, were failing, would continue to fail to hold what was happening.

The pro-Israel demonstration filled the eastern curve of the circle. Five hundred forty-one Israeli flags by his quick count, the blue and white creating a sea that reminded him of prayer shawls, of sky, of his grandmother's good china that only came out for holidays they'd stopped celebrating. "Bring Them Home" banners—eighteen of them, chai, life, the number everywhere now that he'd learned to see it, to count it, to feel it pulse in crowds that gathered like antibodies against infection, against extinction, against the forgetting that felt like dying.

He recognized her immediately—Rachel from synagogue, from Shabbat services he'd been attending for two weeks now, from the careful conversations over wine and challah where everyone talked around the horror, through it, beneath it, but never directly at it because looking straight at it would mean admitting something about the world that made regular life impossible.

She stood with a sign that bore seven Hebrew words he couldn't read but recognized as prayer, as plea, as the kind of thing you write when writing is all you have. Her face different in daylight, in protest, in the particular exhaustion that came from defending your right to exist to people who questioned not just policies but your humanity, your history, your dead.

The chanting: "Am Yisrael Chai"—the people of Israel live. Again and again, the words becoming rhythm, becoming heartbeat, becoming the sound a body makes when it refuses to stop despite everything, everyone, the entire world sometimes feeling like it wanted you gone or at least quiet, at least apologetic, at least willing to contextualize your grief within everyone else's anger.

He started walking the perimeter, needing to see the whole thing before choosing where to stand, if to stand, how to stand in a city that suddenly required positioning, required declarations, required you to be something more definite than human, than confused, than both/and in a world demanding either/or.

The police barrier required thirty-six steps to navigate—he counted them, the number feeling protective, hidden, righteous in ways he'd been reading about in the books Rabbi Goldfarb kept lending him, pressing into his hands after services with that look that said "read this, understand this, become this."

The other side: different energy, younger, angrier, more familiar in ways that made him uncomfortable because he recognized his own politics from six months ago, a year ago, the lifetime ago before October 7th cracked something open that couldn't be closed.

Seven hundred eighteen people, approximately. The number felt significant—his name in gematria, he'd learned, everything reducible to numbers, to cosmic mathematics that suggested meaning where meaning felt impossible. Palestinian flags, keffiyehs, signs reading "End Apartheid," "Stop Genocide," "From the River to the Sea," the last phrase repeated, chanted, sung in rhythms that made his Jewish body tense even as his progressive mind tried to explain, to contextualize, to understand.

That's when he saw Aaron.

His best friend since freshman year at NYU, his roommate through law school applications, through breakups, through his grandmother's death when Aaron had sat shiva with him despite Ethan not knowing that's what they were doing. Aaron who'd become a civil rights lawyer, who defended immigrants, who quoted James Baldwin and Abraham Joshua Heschel with equal reverence.

Aaron wearing a keffiyeh.

The pattern traditional—he could see seventy distinct geometric shapes in the black and white, the number meaning something about completion, about universality, about the world containing multitudes that couldn't be simplified into opposing crowds even though here they were, opposed, crowded, simple in their certainty.

"From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free"—the chant rising as Ethan approached, his feet carrying him toward Aaron despite his mind screaming stop, wait, think, you're not ready for this conversation, this confrontation, this collapse of friendship into ideology.

Aaron saw him at 2:18 PM exactly. His face shifted—surprise, pleasure, relief, then confusion as he took in Ethan's appearance, the Star of David barely visible beneath his jacket but visible enough, the way he stood that suggested he wasn't entirely here, wasn't entirely anywhere, was suspended between crowds like a particle between states, waiting for observation to collapse him into position.

"Ethan! Thank God. I've been texting you for days."

The embrace automatic, muscle memory from eighteen years of friendship, though the keffiyeh against his cheek felt like betrayal, like costume, like Aaron playing at revolution with other people's symbols, other people's struggle, other people's pain that he'd adopted because it fit his narrative of justice, of righteousness, of being on the right side of history.

"This is incredible, right?" Aaron gestured at the crowd, at the energy, at the young people with their phones out, livestreaming revolution, or resistance, or whatever they called it when you stood in Columbus Circle on a Saturday afternoon making complexity simple, making tragedy political, making Jews feel like strangers in their own grief.

"It's something," Ethan managed.

"Something? It's powerful. It's necessary. We're witnessing genocide, Ethan. Actual genocide. And the whole world is finally waking up to what Israel really is."

The words hung between them for exactly thirteen seconds—Ethan counted them, the number of mercy, of transformation, of the divine attributes that either meant everything or nothing depending on what you believed, who you were, where you stood.

"It's complex—"

"Complex?" Aaron's voice sharpened, the lawyer voice, the one that won cases, that demolished opposition, that made truth out of argument. "They're murdering children, Ethan. Children. Children."

Three times he said it, the repetition ritualistic, intentional, designed to prevent response because who could argue against children, against innocence, against the simple moral clarity that one side was killing and therefore wrong, the other side was dying and therefore right.

"So were Hamas."

The words emerged without decision, without thought, just fact expelled like breath, like truth, like the thing you're not supposed to say because it complicates the narrative, because it makes victims into vectors of violence, because it suggests that maybe, maybe everyone was right and wrong simultaneously, which was unbearable, unthinkable, unspeakable except he'd spoken it.

Aaron's face changed at exactly 2:41 PM—Ethan saw the time on the CNN ticker behind him, the numbers adding to seven, to completion, to the end of something that had taken eighteen years to build and seven seconds to destroy.

"What did you say?"

"October 7th. They murdered children too. Babies. Families. Peace activists. At a music festival, Aaron. They hunted them."

"That's different—"

"How?"

"Because Israel is the oppressor. Because Palestinians are fighting for liberation. Because—" Aaron stopped, really looking at Ethan for the first time, taking in the Star of David now fully visible, the way his body had unconsciously shifted toward the other crowd, the Jewish crowd, the grieving crowd, the crowd Aaron had apparently decided was the enemy. "Oh my God. You've gone full Zionist."

"I don't even know what that word means anymore."

"It means supporting apartheid. It means choosing tribalism over justice. It means—" Aaron's voice rising, drawing attention, making them a spectacle, a microcosm, a friendship dying in public while strangers filmed it for content, for evidence, for the endless archive of division. "I can't believe this. My grandmother survived Auschwitz so I could recognize genocide when I see it."

"Your grandmother survived Auschwitz so you could be here. Alive. Jewish. Free to stand with whoever you want, even people who would celebrate your death if they knew what you were."

"What I am? I'm not religious, Ethan. I'm not a Zionist. I'm not part of this tribal—"

"You're Jewish, Aaron. Whether you claim it or not. Whether you want it or not. Your grandmother's numbers are in your DNA even if you can't see them."

The bottle flew at 3:13 PM. Not at them but near them, from one crowd toward the other, the glass shattering against police shields, the sound like crystalline disaster, like windows breaking, like November 1938 though that was the wrong reference, the wrong history, except all history felt present now, all violence rhyming with all other violence in patterns that repeated, repeated, repeated.

The surge came from both sides. Seventy people moving forward from each crowd, the police line holding, barely, batons out, voices commanding "MOVE BACK MOVE BACK MOVE BACK" in rhythms that matched the chanting that hadn't stopped, wouldn't stop, the "FREE PALESTINE" mixing with "AM YISRAEL CHAI" into cacophony that sounded like the Tower of Babel, like languages dividing, like humanity forgetting how to speak to itself.

Ethan found himself in the middle, the exact middle, the space between spaces where bodies pressed from all directions, where breathing became difficult, where for exactly one hundred twenty-four seconds—his gematria value in time, in space, in this impossible position—he couldn't move, couldn't choose, couldn't be anything but suspended between narratives that both claimed him, rejected him, demanded his allegiance.

"ARE YOU A ZIONIST?"

The activist appeared from nowhere, or from the crowd, or from the inevitable confrontation Ethan had been avoiding, approaching. Young, white, privileged in ways that made their keffiyeh feel like fashion, like statement, like the kind of revolution you could take off when you got home to your parents' brownstone.

"Are you?" Repeated, louder, phone out, recording, making content from conflict, from Ethan's frozen face, from his inability to answer because the answer required definitions he didn't have, positions he couldn't take, simplicity he couldn't perform.

"I don't know what I am."

Twenty-one letters in his response, adding to three, to completion through divine action, though this felt like the opposite of divine, felt like hell, like the world splitting apart at Columbus Circle while tourists took pictures and hot dog vendors continued selling and life went on around this pocket of hatred that might have been love, might have been justice, might have been anything if it wasn't so certain, so pure, so absolutely convinced of its own righteousness.

The spit landed seven inches from his feet. The activist moving on to other targets, other content, other confrontations that would go viral, would prove points, would change nothing except to deepen the divisions that already felt infinite, unbridgeable, permanent.

"Ethan!"

Rachel's voice, her hand on his arm, pulling him away from the center, from the conflict, from the space between spaces toward something that might have been safety or might have been choosing sides, he couldn't tell anymore, couldn't think through the sound of chanting, of sirens, of his own heart breaking for Aaron who was already gone, swallowed by his crowd, his cause, his certainty that made him free from the complexity Ethan couldn't escape.

"Your people need you," Rachel said, had to shout over the noise, the chaos, the sound of democracy or disaster, depending on your position.

"Which people?"

The question took her seven seconds to understand, to process, to recognize as real rather than rhetorical. When she answered, her voice was softer, sadder, more honest than any slogan:

"The ones who are asking the same question."

She left him there, returning to her sign, her vigil, her absolutely certain uncertain position that being Jewish meant something, meant everything, meant nothing if it didn't mean survival, solidarity, the ancient stubborn insistence on continuing despite the world's regular suggestions otherwise.

Ethan walked away at 3:47 PM, the numbers random, meaningless, except everything had meaning now, had weight, had consequence he couldn't calculate but could feel accumulating like gravity, like history, like the inheritance he'd spent thirty-three years refusing but which had been patient, had been waiting, had been inevitable.

Through the park, the protests still audible five hundred forty-one yards away—Israel's value in distance, in space, in the gap between what he'd been and what he was becoming. The reservoir reflecting sky that couldn't decide between sun and clouds, between rain and clarity, between the kind of day that made you grateful and the kind that made you grieve, though maybe they were the same day, the same sky, the same water reflecting the same confused light.

His phone: three texts from Aaron, three from Rachel, six messages total that he deleted without reading because reading would mean responding and responding would mean choosing and choosing would mean losing something, someone, some part of himself that had believed in the luxury of neutrality, in the possibility of both/and, in the kind of progressivism that included everyone, even yourself, even your people, even your dead.

He sat by the water for thirty-six minutes—that number again, the hidden righteous, the minimum required to keep the world from falling apart, though it felt like falling apart anyway, felt like the center not holding, felt like Yeats was right about rough beasts slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.

A family of ducks swam past, indifferent to human conflict, to ideological warfare, to the protests still echoing across the park like the sound of the world arguing with itself about who deserved to live, who deserved to die, who deserved sympathy, who deserved solidarity, who deserved anything in a world where deserving had become currency, had become weapon, had become the way we decided who was human and who was context.

His grandmother would have understood this. Would have recognized the sound of crowds turning against each other, against Jews, against complexity. Would have known that "Never Again" meant different things to different people, that memory could be mobilized for any cause, that trauma could justify anything if you arranged it right, if you claimed it right, if you performed it with enough conviction.

But she would have also known something else, something Ethan was only beginning to understand: that sometimes you had to choose not because you were certain but because choosing was the only way to honor the dead, to protect the living, to insist that your particular grief, your specific history, your actual people mattered even when the world demanded you universalize your pain into principles that included everyone except yourself.

Walking home across the bridge as sunset approached, Manhattan behind him lit gold and shadow, Brooklyn ahead promising nothing but the same apartment, the same loneliness, the same questions that multiplied faster than answers could form. But different now. Charged now. Pregnant with decision that was growing, gestating, preparing to be born into action he couldn't yet name but could feel gathering like storm, like prayer, like the ancient Jewish muscle memory of surviving not by being right but by being, simply, stubbornly, impossibly still here.

That night, Ethan watched protest footage on social media, each side sharing clips that proved their point, that demonstrated their righteousness, that converted complexity into content that could be liked, shared, forgotten by tomorrow when new tragedies would demand new positions, new protests, new performances of certainty he would never possess.

His reflection in the black screen showed a face he didn't recognize—older, more Jewish somehow, carrying something ancient in the eyes that had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with recognition, with the cellular understanding that some things were written in blood, in bone, in the DNA Aaron thought he could transcend through politics, through principles, through the kind of universalism that required you to erase your particulars, your people, yourself.

He closed his laptop and picked up the Zohar the rabbi had given him, the pages falling open to a passage he'd marked without understanding: "The world is sustained by three things: justice, truth, and peace."

But whose justice? Whose truth? Whose peace?

The questions echoed as he read Hebrew letters that swam like living things, like possibilities, like the ancient technology of survival through study, through interpretation, through the endless argument with God, with text, with yourself about what it meant to be human when humanity was the question, not the answer.

Outside, sirens wailed through the city—ambulance, police, fire, the trinity of emergency that was New York's constant prayer, its acknowledgment that disaster was always happening somewhere, to someone, right now. He read until his eyes burned, until the Hebrew began making sense not as language but as music, as mathematics, as the deep structure of something that existed before Columbus Circle, before America, before the division of the world into sides that demanded you choose.

But choosing was coming. He could feel it building in his chest where his heart beat with the rhythm of two names—Ethan, the American who believed in progress, in justice, in the arc of history bending toward righteousness; and Israel, the wrestler with angels, the one who struggled with God and humans and prevailed not by winning but by refusing to let go, by insisting the blessing come even if it meant limping forever, marked forever, changed forever by the encounter with something that wouldn't release him and whom he couldn't release.

His phone lit with one final message, this one from a number he didn't recognize:

"If you go to Israel, we're done. You'll be complicit in apartheid. This is Aaron on Rachel's phone. She gave me your new number. I'm trying to save you from becoming something you'll regret. Choose carefully."

The message arrived at 11:47 PM, the same numbers from the morning, the Boeing falling, the crash happening, the moment when choosing became not just necessary but inevitable, not just personal but historical, not just about him but about every Jew who'd ever stood between crowds and felt the ground split, felt the world demand they pick a side in a conflict that was older than memory, newer than tomorrow, eternal as the question that wouldn't stop asking itself: 

Who are you when the world divides? 

What are you when identity is battlefield? 

Where do you stand when standing anywhere means betraying someone, something, some part of yourself that thought it could avoid this moment, this choice, this ancient Jewish dilemma of existing in a world that regularly asked you to justify your existence, to choose between your universals and your particulars, to decide whether survival was selfish or necessary or both or neither or the only thing that mattered when mattering itself was in question?

The Zohar fell closed. The sirens faded. The city settled into its restless sleep.

Ethan Israel Stone sat in the darkness of his Brooklyn apartment, feeling the weight of decision gathering like gravity, like history, like the inevitable tomorrow when he would have to choose not just where to stand but who to be, knowing that choosing would cost him something, someone, some version of himself that had believed in the possibility of neutrality in a world that had run out of neutral ground.

The protests would continue tomorrow. The crowds would gather. The signs would wave. The chants would rise.

But Ethan would be looking at flights to Tel Aviv, to Jerusalem, to the place where his middle name meant something more than metaphor, where wrestling with angels was not theoretical but actual, where choosing Jewish meant choosing something that couldn't be explained to Aaron, to the activist with their spit, to anyone who hadn't felt their grandmother's ghost standing in Columbus Circle, pointing not to either crowd but beyond them, past them, through them to something older, deeper, truer than protests, than politics, than the endless American argument about who deserved what.

She would have pointed home.

And finally, finally, after thirty-three years of avoiding it, Ethan was beginning to understand what that meant.
