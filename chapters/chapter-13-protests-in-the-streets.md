# Chapter 13: Protests in the Streets

The protest signs read "Never Again" on one side of Columbus Circle and "Free Palestine" on the other, the competing slogans creating a geometry of irreconcilable truths.

Saturday, October 21st. Two weeks since the vigil at Washington Square, but it felt like years.

He'd come to observe. That's what he told himself walking from the subway. But the competing sounds drew him in—two crowds at opposite ends of Columbus Circle, police barriers between them, the air thick with October cold and something else. Rage, maybe. Or fear dressed up as righteousness.

The chants hit him from blocks away—"Never Again" colliding with "Free Palestine," the words tangling into something that made his teeth ache. Police everywhere, horses, barriers, news vans. The smell of hot dogs from a cart mixed with tear gas from somewhere, from memory, from the anticipation of violence everyone felt coming.

The pro-Israel demonstration filled the eastern curve. Blue and white flags rippling like prayer shawls in the wind. "Bring Them Home" banners with faces of hostages—real faces, real names. A woman held a photo of her nephew, twenty-three, taken from the music festival. Her hand shook. Small details that broke through the noise: trembling fingers, tears cutting tracks through makeup, the way she kept touching the photo like it might dissolve.

He recognized her immediately—Rachel from synagogue, from Shabbat services he'd been attending for two weeks now, from the careful conversations over wine and challah where everyone talked around the horror, through it, beneath it, but never directly at it because looking straight at it would mean admitting something about the world that made regular life impossible.

She held a sign in Hebrew he couldn't read. Dark circles under her eyes, her voice hoarse from chanting or crying or both. When she saw him, something shifted in her expression—relief, maybe, at seeing another familiar face in the chaos.

"Am Yisrael Chai"—the people of Israel live. But next to Rachel, an older Jewish man held a different sign: "Not In My Name." He wore a kippah and a Palestinian solidarity pin. The contradiction made Ethan's head spin. The man caught his stare.

"You can be Jewish and oppose occupation," the man said quietly. "My grandfather didn't survive the camps so we could become what we fled."

Rachel turned away, jaw tight.

He walked the perimeter, caught between worlds. The police barriers felt both protective and divisive—keeping the crowds apart but also keeping something else separate. Understanding, maybe. Or the possibility of it.

The Palestinian solidarity side: younger, louder, more diverse. A mix of students, activists, families. A Palestinian woman held her daughter's hand, maybe seven years old, wearing a small keffiyeh. The girl's sign read "I Want To See My Grandma in Gaza." Simple. Devastating. True.

Near them, white kids from Columbia chanted "From the River to the Sea." The Palestinian mother winced at their volume, pulled her daughter closer. There were layers here Ethan hadn't expected—not everyone on the same side wanted the same thing, or wanted it the same way.

That's when he saw Aaron.

His best friend since freshman year at NYU, his roommate through law school applications, through breakups, through his grandmother's death when Aaron had sat shiva with him despite Ethan not knowing that's what they were doing. Aaron who'd become a civil rights lawyer, who defended immigrants, who quoted James Baldwin and Abraham Joshua Heschel with equal reverence.

Aaron wearing a keffiyeh.

The same Aaron who'd gone with him to that first protest together—Occupy Wall Street, 2011, both of them twenty-two and certain they could change everything. "We're on the right side of history," Aaron had said then, arm around Ethan's shoulder, both of them drunk on possibility.

"From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free."

The chant rose as their eyes met—eighteen years of friendship compressed into three seconds of recognition, evaluation, disappointment.

"Ethan! Thank God. I've been texting you for days."

The embrace automatic, muscle memory from eighteen years of friendship, though the keffiyeh against his cheek felt like betrayal, like costume, like Aaron playing at revolution with other people's symbols, other people's struggle, other people's pain that he'd adopted because it fit his narrative of justice, of righteousness, of being on the right side of history.

"This is incredible, right?" Aaron's voice carried forced enthusiasm.

"Aaron—"

"We're witnessing genocide, Ethan. The whole world is finally waking up."

A woman near them, hijabi, Palestinian flag draped over her shoulders, glanced at Aaron with something like exhaustion. "Please," she said quietly, "this isn't about waking up. My family has been awake for seventy years."

Aaron flushed, adjusted his keffiyeh.

"It's complex—"

"Complex?" Aaron's voice sharpened. "They're murdering children, Ethan."

"I know. I saw the videos from Gaza. I also saw—" Ethan's voice cracked. "The babies from the kibbutz. The—"

"That's different—"

"How? Tell me how dead children are different."

The Palestinian woman from earlier moved closer, her daughter now on her hip. "Please," she said to both of them. "My cousin was at that music festival. She was a peace activist. She taught Arabic to Israeli children." Her voice broke. "Hamas killed her too. But her death doesn't justify—" She gestured helplessly at her daughter. "This one asks for her aunt every day."

Aaron's face went white. The woman walked away before either of them could respond.

"I didn't know," Aaron said quietly.

"There's a lot we don't know." Ethan's voice came out tired. "October 7th—"

"Don't." Aaron's defenses snapped back up. "One tragedy doesn't excuse—"

"I'm not excusing anything. I'm just—" Ethan looked at his oldest friend, seeing a stranger in a keffiyeh. "When did we stop being able to hold two truths at once?"

"When one truth requires ignoring genocide."

"Or when the other requires ignoring massacres."

They stood there, eighteen years of friendship fracturing in real time. Behind Aaron, the CNN ticker showed the death toll climbing on both sides.

"You've gone full Zionist," Aaron said, but it sounded more like a question than an accusation.

"I don't even know what that word means anymore. Does it mean I think Jews deserve a homeland? That my cousins in Tel Aviv deserve to live? Or does it mean supporting every policy, every settlement, every—"

"It means choosing tribalism over justice."

The Jewish man with the "Not In My Name" sign approached them. "Young man," he said to Aaron, "I've been fighting for Palestinian rights for thirty years. But throwing around 'Zionist' like it's a slur? That's not helping anyone. Especially not Palestinians."

Aaron flushed deeper. "I'm Jewish too. My grandmother—"

"Survived the camps?" The man's voice was gentle. "So did mine. That's why I fight occupation. But it's also why I won't let anyone tell me Jews don't deserve safety somewhere."

"Safety built on someone else's catastrophe?"

"Every nation is built on someone's catastrophe. The question is what we do now." The man looked between them. "You two are friends?"

"Were," Aaron said at the same moment Ethan said, "Are."

A bottle flew—glass shattering against police shields. Then the surge: bodies pressing forward from both sides, horses rearing, batons out. The smell of pepper spray cut through everything.

"MOVE BACK! MOVE BACK!"

Someone shoved Ethan hard from behind. He stumbled forward, catching himself against Aaron, who grabbed his arm instinctively—muscle memory of friendship overriding everything else. For a second they were just two scared kids from NYU again, holding each other up in the chaos.

The crowd compressed, bodies pressing from all directions. Ethan couldn't breathe, couldn't move. A woman in a hijab fell beside him; he pulled her up without thinking. She gripped his hand hard, terror universal across any divide. Someone was screaming in Hebrew. Someone else in Arabic. The same panic in different languages.

"ARE YOU A ZIONIST?"

A young activist, maybe nineteen, phone out, hunting for content. Behind them, the woman whose nephew was a hostage had collapsed, sobbing. No one filmed that.

"Are you a Zionist?" Louder now, performative.

"I'm a human being watching other human beings suffer," Ethan said.

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer that matters."

The activist spit near his feet, moved on to easier targets. But the Palestinian mother from earlier caught Ethan's eye, gave him the slightest nod. Not agreement, exactly. Maybe just recognition that nothing here was as simple as the chants pretended.

"Ethan!"

Rachel's voice, her hand on his arm, pulling him away from the center, from the conflict, from the space between spaces toward something that might have been safety or might have been choosing sides, he couldn't tell anymore, couldn't think through the sound of chanting, of sirens, of his own heart breaking for Aaron who was already gone, swallowed by his crowd, his cause, his certainty that made him free from the complexity Ethan couldn't escape.

"Your people need you," Rachel said, but her voice was uncertain.

"Which people?" 

"I don't know anymore." She looked exhausted. "My brother's in the IDF. My cousin works for B'Tselem documenting violations. Family dinners are..." She laughed bitterly. "We're all Jews. We all want to survive. We can't agree on what that means."

"The ones asking the same question," she said finally. "Those are your people."

She left him there, returning to her sign, her vigil, her absolutely certain uncertain position that being Jewish meant something, meant everything, meant nothing if it didn't mean survival, solidarity, the ancient stubborn insistence on continuing despite the world's regular suggestions otherwise.

Ethan walked away, the protests still audible behind him. By the reservoir, a Jewish father taught his son to skip stones while wearing a "Ceasefire Now" button. Life continuing despite everything.

He already knew he would book a flight to Tel Aviv. Had known since seeing Aaron in the keffiyeh, since the Palestinian mother's story about her cousin, since realizing that understanding required proximity to pain, not distance from it.

His phone buzzed with texts:

Aaron: "We need to talk. That woman, what she said..."

Rachel: "I'm sorry about your friend. This is destroying everyone."

His mother: "Saw the news about Columbus Circle. Please tell me you're safe."

He answered only his mother: "I'm safe. Nothing here is."

He sat by the water. Ducks swam past, indifferent to human conflict.

His grandmother would have understood this—crowds turning against complexity. But she would have known something else: sometimes you had to choose not because you were certain but because choosing was the only way to honor the dead.

Walking home across the bridge at sunset, Brooklyn ahead. But different now. The decision already made.

That night, Ethan opened his laptop to book the flight. El Al had seats available. Of course they did.

His phone lit with a message from Aaron:

"I keep thinking about that woman. Her cousin. Remember when we went to that Darfur protest junior year? You said 'bearing witness isn't enough but sometimes it's all we have.' I thought that was bullshit then. Now... My grandfather used to say 'In the camps, we learned that sometimes survival itself is resistance.' I don't know what to do with that."

Then:

"If you go to Israel, tell me what you see. Not what you're supposed to see. What you actually see." 

Ethan typed back: "I already booked the flight."

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again.

"Be careful. Not just physically. Don't let it make you hard."

"Don't let it make you simple," Ethan replied.

A long pause. Then:

"Still brothers?"

"Different sides of the same argument."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer we have."

The conversation ended there. Everything that mattered between them suspended in digital space, waiting for resolution that might never come.

Ethan confirmed his flight. November 4th. Tel Aviv.

Outside, sirens wailed through Brooklyn. The protests would continue tomorrow. The crowds would gather. The chants would rise.

But Ethan would be gone, flying toward the thing itself rather than its representations, toward the place where his middle name meant something beyond metaphor.

The space between crowds was shrinking.

He would go stand in it anyway.
