# Chapter 13: Protests in the Streets

The protest signs read "Never Again" on one side of Columbus Circle and "Free Palestine" on the other, the competing slogans creating a geometry of irreconcilable truths.

Saturday, October 21st. Two weeks since the vigil at Washington Square, but it felt like years.

He'd come to observe. That's what he told himself walking from the subway. But the competing sounds drew him in—two crowds at opposite ends of Columbus Circle, police barriers between them, the air thick with October cold and something else. Rage, maybe. Or fear dressed up as righteousness.

The chants hit him from blocks away—"Never Again" colliding with "Free Palestine," the words tangling into something that made his teeth ache. Police everywhere, horses, barriers, news vans. The smell of hot dogs from a cart mixed with tear gas from somewhere, from memory, from the anticipation of violence everyone felt coming.

The pro-Israel demonstration filled the eastern curve. Blue and white flags rippling like prayer shawls in the wind. "Bring Them Home" banners with faces of hostages—real faces, real names. A woman held a photo of her nephew, twenty-three, taken from the music festival. Her hand shook. Small details that broke through the noise: trembling fingers, tears cutting tracks through makeup, the way she kept touching the photo like it might dissolve.

He recognized her immediately—Rachel from synagogue, from Shabbat services he'd been attending for two weeks now, from the careful conversations over wine and challah where everyone talked around the horror, through it, beneath it, but never directly at it because looking straight at it would mean admitting something about the world that made regular life impossible.

She held a sign in Hebrew he couldn't read. Dark circles under her eyes, her voice hoarse from chanting or crying or both. When she saw him, something shifted in her expression—relief, maybe, at seeing another familiar face in the chaos.

"Am Yisrael Chai"—the people of Israel live. But next to Rachel, an older Jewish man held a different sign: "Not In My Name." He wore a kippah and a Palestinian solidarity pin. The contradiction made Ethan's head spin. The man caught his stare.

"You can be Jewish and oppose occupation," the man said quietly. "My grandfather didn't survive the camps so we could become what we fled."

Rachel turned away, jaw tight.

He walked the perimeter, caught between worlds. The police barriers felt both protective and divisive—keeping the crowds apart but also keeping something else separate. Understanding, maybe. Or the possibility of it.

The Palestinian solidarity side: younger, louder, more diverse. A mix of students, activists, families. A Palestinian woman held her daughter's hand, maybe seven years old, wearing a small keffiyeh. The girl's sign read "I Want To See My Grandma in Gaza." Simple. Devastating. True.

Near them, white kids from Columbia chanted "From the River to the Sea." The Palestinian mother winced at their volume, pulled her daughter closer. There were layers here Ethan hadn't expected—not everyone on the same side wanted the same thing, or wanted it the same way.

That's when he saw Aaron.

His best friend since freshman year at NYU, his roommate through law school applications, through breakups, through his grandmother's death when Aaron had sat shiva with him despite Ethan not knowing that's what they were doing. Aaron who'd become a civil rights lawyer, who defended immigrants, who quoted James Baldwin and Abraham Joshua Heschel with equal reverence.

Aaron wearing a keffiyeh.

The pattern traditional—he could see seventy distinct geometric shapes in the black and white, the number meaning something about completion, about universality, about the world containing multitudes that couldn't be simplified into opposing crowds even though here they were, opposed, crowded, simple in their certainty.

"From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free."

The chant rose as Ethan spotted Aaron in the crowd, wearing a keffiyeh like armor. Their eyes met—eighteen years of friendship compressed into three seconds of recognition, evaluation, disappointment.

"Ethan! Thank God. I've been texting you for days."

The embrace automatic, muscle memory from eighteen years of friendship, though the keffiyeh against his cheek felt like betrayal, like costume, like Aaron playing at revolution with other people's symbols, other people's struggle, other people's pain that he'd adopted because it fit his narrative of justice, of righteousness, of being on the right side of history.

"This is incredible, right?" Aaron's voice carried forced enthusiasm.

"Aaron—"

"We're witnessing genocide, Ethan. The whole world is finally waking up."

A woman near them, hijabi, Palestinian flag draped over her shoulders, glanced at Aaron with something like exhaustion. "Please," she said quietly, "this isn't about waking up. My family has been awake for seventy years."

Aaron flushed, adjusted his keffiyeh.

"It's complex—"

"Complex?" Aaron's voice sharpened. "They're murdering children, Ethan."

"I know. I saw the videos from Gaza. I also saw—" Ethan's voice cracked. "The babies from the kibbutz. The—"

"That's different—"

"How? Tell me how dead children are different."

The Palestinian woman from earlier moved closer, her daughter now on her hip. "Please," she said to both of them. "My cousin was at that music festival. She was a peace activist. She taught Arabic to Israeli children." Her voice broke. "Hamas killed her too. But her death doesn't justify—" She gestured helplessly at her daughter. "This one asks for her aunt every day."

Aaron's face went white. The woman walked away before either of them could respond.

"I didn't know," Aaron said quietly.

"There's a lot we don't know." Ethan's voice came out tired. "October 7th—"

"Don't." Aaron's defenses snapped back up. "One tragedy doesn't excuse—"

"I'm not excusing anything. I'm just—" Ethan looked at his oldest friend, seeing a stranger in a keffiyeh. "When did we stop being able to hold two truths at once?"

"When one truth requires ignoring genocide."

"Or when the other requires ignoring massacres."

They stood there, eighteen years of friendship fracturing in real time. Behind Aaron, the CNN ticker showed the death toll climbing on both sides.

"You've gone full Zionist," Aaron said, but it sounded more like a question than an accusation.

"I don't even know what that word means anymore. Does it mean I think Jews deserve a homeland? That my cousins in Tel Aviv deserve to live? Or does it mean supporting every policy, every settlement, every—"

"It means choosing tribalism over justice."

The Jewish man with the "Not In My Name" sign approached them. "Young man," he said to Aaron, "I've been fighting for Palestinian rights for thirty years. But throwing around 'Zionist' like it's a slur? That's not helping anyone. Especially not Palestinians."

Aaron flushed deeper. "I'm Jewish too. My grandmother—"

"Survived the camps?" The man's voice was gentle. "So did mine. That's why I fight occupation. But it's also why I won't let anyone tell me Jews don't deserve safety somewhere."

"Safety built on someone else's catastrophe?"

"Every nation is built on someone's catastrophe. The question is what we do now." The man looked between them. "You two are friends?"

"Were," Aaron said at the same moment Ethan said, "Are."

A bottle flew—glass shattering against police shields. Then the surge: bodies pressing forward from both sides, horses rearing, batons out. The smell of pepper spray cut through everything.

"MOVE BACK! MOVE BACK!"

Someone shoved Ethan hard from behind. He stumbled forward, catching himself against Aaron, who grabbed his arm instinctively—muscle memory of friendship overriding everything else. For a second they were just two scared kids from NYU again, holding each other up in the chaos.

The crowd compressed, bodies pressing from all directions. Ethan couldn't breathe, couldn't move. A woman in a hijab fell beside him; he pulled her up without thinking. She gripped his hand hard, terror universal across any divide. Someone was screaming in Hebrew. Someone else in Arabic. The same panic in different languages.

"ARE YOU A ZIONIST?"

A young activist, maybe nineteen, phone out, hunting for content. Behind them, the woman whose nephew was a hostage had collapsed, sobbing. No one filmed that.

"Are you a Zionist?" Louder now, performative.

"I'm a human being watching other human beings suffer," Ethan said.

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer that matters."

The activist spit near his feet, moved on to easier targets. But the Palestinian mother from earlier caught Ethan's eye, gave him the slightest nod. Not agreement, exactly. Maybe just recognition that nothing here was as simple as the chants pretended.

"Ethan!"

Rachel's voice, her hand on his arm, pulling him away from the center, from the conflict, from the space between spaces toward something that might have been safety or might have been choosing sides, he couldn't tell anymore, couldn't think through the sound of chanting, of sirens, of his own heart breaking for Aaron who was already gone, swallowed by his crowd, his cause, his certainty that made him free from the complexity Ethan couldn't escape.

"Your people need you," Rachel said, but her voice was uncertain.

"Which people?" 

"I don't know anymore." She looked exhausted. "My brother's in the IDF. My cousin works for B'Tselem documenting violations. Family dinners are..." She laughed bitterly. "We're all Jews. We all want to survive. We can't agree on what that means."

"The ones asking the same question," she said finally. "Those are your people."

She left him there, returning to her sign, her vigil, her absolutely certain uncertain position that being Jewish meant something, meant everything, meant nothing if it didn't mean survival, solidarity, the ancient stubborn insistence on continuing despite the world's regular suggestions otherwise.

Ethan walked away at 3:47 PM, the numbers random, meaningless, except everything had meaning now, had weight, had consequence he couldn't calculate but could feel accumulating like gravity, like history, like the inheritance he'd spent thirty-three years refusing but which had been patient, had been waiting, had been inevitable.

Through the park, the protests still audible behind him. The reservoir reflected a sky that couldn't decide between sun and storm. A Jewish father taught his son to skip stones while wearing a "Ceasefire Now" button. A Palestinian family fed ducks, the children laughing. Life continuing despite everything, or because of everything.

His phone buzzed with texts:

Aaron: "We need to talk. That woman, what she said..."

Rachel: "I'm sorry about your friend. This is destroying everyone."

His mother: "Saw the news about Columbus Circle. Please tell me you're safe."

He answered only his mother: "I'm safe. Nothing here is."

He sat by the water for thirty-six minutes—that number again, the hidden righteous, the minimum required to keep the world from falling apart, though it felt like falling apart anyway, felt like the center not holding, felt like Yeats was right about rough beasts slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.

A family of ducks swam past, indifferent to human conflict, to ideological warfare, to the protests still echoing across the park like the sound of the world arguing with itself about who deserved to live, who deserved to die, who deserved sympathy, who deserved solidarity, who deserved anything in a world where deserving had become currency, had become weapon, had become the way we decided who was human and who was context.

His grandmother would have understood this. Would have recognized the sound of crowds turning against each other, against Jews, against complexity. Would have known that "Never Again" meant different things to different people, that memory could be mobilized for any cause, that trauma could justify anything if you arranged it right, if you claimed it right, if you performed it with enough conviction.

But she would have also known something else, something Ethan was only beginning to understand: that sometimes you had to choose not because you were certain but because choosing was the only way to honor the dead, to protect the living, to insist that your particular grief, your specific history, your actual people mattered even when the world demanded you universalize your pain into principles that included everyone except yourself.

Walking home across the bridge as sunset approached, Manhattan behind him lit gold and shadow, Brooklyn ahead promising nothing but the same apartment, the same loneliness, the same questions that multiplied faster than answers could form. But different now. Charged now. Pregnant with decision that was growing, gestating, preparing to be born into action he couldn't yet name but could feel gathering like storm, like prayer, like the ancient Jewish muscle memory of surviving not by being right but by being, simply, stubbornly, impossibly still here.

That night, Ethan watched protest footage on social media, each side sharing clips that proved their point, that demonstrated their righteousness, that converted complexity into content that could be liked, shared, forgotten by tomorrow when new tragedies would demand new positions, new protests, new performances of certainty he would never possess.

His reflection in the black screen showed a face he didn't recognize—older, more Jewish somehow, carrying something ancient in the eyes that had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with recognition, with the cellular understanding that some things were written in blood, in bone, in the DNA Aaron thought he could transcend through politics, through principles, through the kind of universalism that required you to erase your particulars, your people, yourself.

He closed his laptop and picked up the Zohar the rabbi had given him, the pages falling open to a passage he'd marked without understanding: "The world is sustained by three things: justice, truth, and peace."

But whose justice? Whose truth? Whose peace?

The questions echoed as he read Hebrew letters that swam like living things, like possibilities, like the ancient technology of survival through study, through interpretation, through the endless argument with God, with text, with yourself about what it meant to be human when humanity was the question, not the answer.

Outside, sirens wailed through the city—ambulance, police, fire, the trinity of emergency that was New York's constant prayer, its acknowledgment that disaster was always happening somewhere, to someone, right now. He read until his eyes burned, until the Hebrew began making sense not as language but as music, as mathematics, as the deep structure of something that existed before Columbus Circle, before America, before the division of the world into sides that demanded you choose.

But choosing was coming. Not between sides—he was beginning to understand there were more than two. Between the person he'd been and whoever he was becoming. Between simple answers and complicated questions. Between the safety of certainty and the difficulty of doubt.

His phone lit with one final message, this one from a number he didn't recognize:

A final message from Aaron, later:

"I keep thinking about that woman. Her cousin. I want to believe there's a way to hold all of this. The occupation is wrong. October 7th was wrong. The bombing is wrong. But my grandfather—he used to say 'In the camps, we learned that sometimes survival itself is resistance.' I don't know what to do with that. Do you?"

Then:

"If you go to Israel, can you... can you try to understand? Not excuse. Just understand. And then tell me. Because I can't go. But I need to know." 

The questions remained:

Who are you when the world divides? 

What are you when everyone demands you choose?

But maybe the answer wasn't choosing sides. Maybe it was choosing to see the human faces on all sides—the trembling woman with her nephew's photo, the Palestinian mother and her daughter, the Jewish man rejecting easy answers, Aaron struggling with his grandfather's ghost, Rachel exhausted from defending her existence.

The Zohar fell closed. The sirens faded. The city settled into its restless sleep.

Ethan Israel Stone sat in the darkness of his Brooklyn apartment, feeling the weight of decision gathering like gravity, like history, like the inevitable tomorrow when he would have to choose not just where to stand but who to be, knowing that choosing would cost him something, someone, some version of himself that had believed in the possibility of neutrality in a world that had run out of neutral ground.

The protests would continue tomorrow. The crowds would gather. The signs would wave. The chants would rise.

Ethan would book a flight to Tel Aviv. Not to choose a side, but to see with his own eyes what couldn't be understood from Columbus Circle. To stand where his middle name meant something real. To wrestle with questions that had no clean answers.

His grandmother wouldn't have pointed to either crowd. She would have pointed to the space between them—the impossible, necessary space where people could hold multiple truths, multiple griefs, multiple hopes without requiring anyone else to disappear.

That space was shrinking.

But it was the only place Ethan could imagine standing without losing his soul.
