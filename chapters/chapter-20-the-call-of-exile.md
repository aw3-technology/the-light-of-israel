# Chapter 20: The Call of Exile

The dream came in Aramaic, and Ethan woke knowing he had to leave the Holy Land.

He sat up in Sera's bed, sweat-soaked, gasping. Through the window, Jerusalem's pre-dawn darkness pressed against the glass. A siren wailed somewhere—ambulance or police, constant soundtrack since the stabbing near Damascus Gate yesterday. Beside him, Sera stirred but didn't wake, her breath steady despite the Glock she now kept in the nightstand.

The dream lingered: his grandmother, young—impossibly young—standing in ruins, pointing west. Behind her, shadows with yellow stars. "Find where we were lost," she'd said in Aramaic. But also: "They're watching. They know you're here."

Ethan slipped out of bed onto the small balcony. November cold bit through his t-shirt. Below, a street sweeper pushed his cart, bristles scraping stone. His phone: 5:41 AM.

"The visa expires in two weeks."

Sera stood in the doorway, wrapped in the sheet, holding his passport. She'd been checking dates again.

"I know."

"And that investigator from the Interior Ministry called yesterday. About your 'sudden religious awakening.'" Her voice caught. "They're suspicious, Ethan. Americans who come here and... change too quickly."

"I don't understand it," Ethan said. "We just... we just found each other. The Dead Sea, Masada, everything we've shared—"

"Ethan." She moved beside him, her warmth a counterpoint to the morning cold. "Some journeys you take alone. That's how you know they're yours."

Inside, she made coffee while he tried to explain the dream. The words came out jumbled—Aramaic and ruins, his grandmother young, voices calling in languages he'd never studied but recognized in his bones.

"I need to see Rabbi Levi," he said.

"He's expecting you," Sera said simply. When Ethan looked surprised, she smiled. "He called yesterday. Said to send you when you were ready."

The rabbi's study felt different. Maps covered his usually clear desk—Europe, Mediterranean, North Africa. Red pins like wounds.

""They're watching," Rabbi Levi said, not looking up from the maps. "But that's not why you're leaving."

"The dream. Tell me."

As Ethan spoke, the rabbi's fingers found cities on the map. Warsaw. Rome. Berlin. "West," the rabbi murmured. "She pointed west."

"They're getting nervous," he said, glancing at the window. "American who changes too fast, asks too many questions."

"But I just—"

"Started? Yes. And you could stay, fight the bureaucracy, wait for lawyers." The rabbi's eyes were kind but firm. "Or you could follow the dream. Your grandmother pointed west for a reason."

Four cities, the rabbi explained, pushing yellowed tickets across the desk. Athens, Rome, Berlin, Cairo. "Where we were lost," he said. "Where sparks still wait." A Lithuanian couple's cancelled tour—their son had been called up for reserves. "Their loss, your escape route."

"You have three days," Rabbi Levi said. "Your grandmother's birthday is November 30th—make that your departure. Tell them you're touring Jewish heritage sites. Come back on a different visa, when things calm down."

"Three days?"

"Tomorrow they might revoke your permit to stay in East Jerusalem. The day after, who knows?"

At the travel agency, a stressed agent found him tickets—a Lithuanian couple's cancellation. "Cash only," he said. Athens, Rome, Berlin, Cairo.

"My grandfather walked these cities," the agent said quietly. "Running. You'll fly them. Looking." The dream image flashed—his grandmother pointing west, shadows behind her.

Sera was packing when he returned—not cooking. Her military duffle on the bed.

"Reserve duty," she said without looking up. "Twelve hours' notice. Gaza border."

"When?"

"Tomorrow night." She finally faced him, eyes red. "So you leave for your exile, I leave for mine. At least yours has museums."

"Sera—"

"Don't. Just... we have tonight. One night before everything changes."

That night, they held each other like drowning people.

"I might not have email access," she said into the darkness. "Or phone. For weeks."

"I know."

"If something happens—"

"Nothing will happen."

"Ethan." Her voice was steel. "Things happen. This is Israel. Things always happen."

His mother called the next morning.

"The State Department issued a warning," his mother's voice shook through WhatsApp. "They're telling Americans to leave Israel. What aren't you telling me?"

"I'm leaving tomorrow."

"Thank God. Come home."

"I'm going to Athens. Then Rome, Berlin—"

"Have you lost your mind? There were synagogue attacks in Berlin last week!"

"Mom—"

"That Israeli girl. This is about her. You're following her somewhere."

"She's being deployed, Mom. To Gaza."

Silence. Then: "Oh, sweetheart. Oh no."

Rabbi Levi's study, night before departure. Maps gone. One candle.

"Exile isn't punishment." His voice carried old authority. "It's how sparks spread. How light finds its way into dark places."

He pressed something into Ethan's hand—a travel mezuzah, worn smooth.

"Every doorway you pass through..."

"I know."

"No. You'll learn." The rabbi stood, suddenly old. "Being lost and finding—you think they're different?"

Through the window, an ambulance siren. Then another.

"Go," Rabbi Levi said. "Find what we lost. Gather what we scattered. Your grandmother knew—the sparks are waiting."

The last night with Sera, they lit candles. Not Friday, but it felt like Shabbat anyway. Sacred time carved from ordinary Tuesday.

"My unit—" she started in the darkness, then stopped.

He waited.

"Tunnel rats. That's what they call us."

The weight of it—what tunnels meant in Gaza, what finding them meant, what entering them meant.


Outside, the scream of an F-16. They both knew what that meant. The war was already everywhere.

Ben Gurion Airport, 4 AM. Sera drove in uniform, her rifle in the back seat.

At departures, she pressed the Dead Sea stone into his palm.

"To remember," she said. "That you can float."

Security took three hours. They knew his file, his West Bank visits. "Forty days," he told them. "Tourist visa when I return."


At the gate, final security. Behind the glass, Sera in uniform. She wasn't supposed to be here—had pulled rank, used connections. Their eyes met across the security line.

She pressed her hand to the glass. He matched it. Through the barrier, she mouthed something in Hebrew—three words he didn't know.

Then she broke. One tear, quickly wiped. She touched her rifle strap—a soldier's gesture, checking equipment—and was gone.

The gate agent called his row. Ethan stood, legs unsteady.

Through the boarding bridge window: her unit's van, diesel exhaust in dawn light. South. Toward Gaza.

In his seat, the engines starting, Ethan finally understood her Hebrew words. They came to him suddenly, like memory:

*Ani ohevet otcha.*

I love you.

She'd never said it in English. Saved it for goodbye.

The plane lifted. Below, Israel became coast, became memory, became something he'd have to earn the right to return to.

The Mediterranean spread below, the same sea Jews had been crossing for millennia. But this time, Ethan wasn't fleeing.

He was being sent.

In his pocket, the travel mezuzah Rabbi Levi had pressed into his palm grew warm against his fingers. Each doorway he would cross, each city he would enter—carrying the spark west, following his grandmother's pointing hand into exile that wasn't exile but mission.

The spark that could not be extinguished, only scattered. Only spread.
