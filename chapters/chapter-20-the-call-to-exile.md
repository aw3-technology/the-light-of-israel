# Chapter 20: The Call to Exile

The dream came in Aramaic, and Ethan woke knowing he had to leave the Holy Land.

He sat up in Sera's bed, sweat-soaked, gasping. Through the window, Jerusalem's pre-dawn darkness pressed against the glass. A siren wailed somewhere—ambulance or police, constant soundtrack since the stabbing near Damascus Gate yesterday. Beside him, Sera stirred but didn't wake, her breath steady despite the Glock she now kept in the nightstand.

The dream lingered: his grandmother, young—impossibly young—standing in ruins, pointing west. Behind her, shadows with yellow stars. "Find where we were lost," she'd said in Aramaic. But also: "They're watching. They know you're here."

Ethan slipped out of bed onto the small balcony. November cold bit through his t-shirt. Below, a street sweeper pushed his cart, bristles scraping stone. His phone: 5:41 AM.

"The visa expires in two weeks."

Sera stood in the doorway, wrapped in the sheet, holding his passport. She'd been checking dates again.

"I know."

"And that investigator from the Interior Ministry called yesterday. About your 'sudden religious awakening.'" Her voice caught. "They're suspicious, Ethan. Americans who come here and... change too quickly."

"I don't understand it," Ethan said. "We just... we just found each other. The Dead Sea, Masada, everything we've shared—"

"Ethan." She moved beside him, her warmth a counterpoint to the morning cold. "Some journeys you take alone. That's how you know they're yours."

Inside, she made coffee while he tried to explain the dream. The words came out jumbled—Aramaic and ruins, his grandmother young, voices calling in languages he'd never studied but recognized in his bones.

"I need to see Rabbi Levi," he said.

"He's expecting you," Sera said simply. When Ethan looked surprised, she smiled. "He called yesterday. Said to send you when you were ready."

The rabbi's study had become familiar territory over the past weeks, but this morning it felt different. Maps covered his usually clear desk—Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa. Red pins marked cities like wounds.

"You're being watched," Rabbi Levi said without preamble. "The Shabak has questions. An American, suddenly religious, visiting sensitive sites." He pulled out a folder—Ethan's photo at the Western Wall, at protests, with Palestinian peace activists. "They think you might be a problem."

"I'm not—"

"I know. But staying makes it worse. The dream—tell me about the dream."

As Ethan recounted it, the rabbi's fingers traced the maps with new urgency.

"Leave within the week. Make it look like tourism. The exile roads will teach you, but also—" He glanced at the window. "Also they'll stop watching once you're gone."

"But I just got here. I'm just beginning to—"

"The security services don't care about your spiritual timeline." The rabbi's voice hardened. "Leave voluntarily or be deported. Those are your options."

Four cities, the rabbi explained, pushing yellowed tickets across the desk. Athens, Rome, Berlin, Cairo. A Lithuanian couple's cancelled tour—their son had been called up for reserves. "Their loss, your escape route."

"You have three days," Rabbi Levi said. "Your grandmother's birthday is November 30th—make that your departure. Tell them you're touring Jewish heritage sites. Come back on a different visa, when things calm down."

"Three days?"

"Tomorrow they might revoke your permit to stay in East Jerusalem. The day after, who knows?"

At the travel agency on King George Street, the agent's hands shook as he typed. A bomb threat had evacuated the building next door an hour ago.

"You want to leave this week?" He glanced at the window—IDF soldiers stationed outside. "Smart. My son's unit just got called up. Something's coming."

He found flights—a Lithuanian couple had canceled after yesterday's stabbing. "Heritage tour tickets. Transferable. Cash only."

"Sometimes the journey chooses you," he said, printing tickets. "My grandfather walked these routes by foot, hiding. You fly them seeking. Same journey, different direction."

Sera was packing when he returned—not cooking. Her military duffle on the bed.

"Reserve duty," she said without looking up. "Twelve hours' notice. Gaza border."

"When?"

"Tomorrow night." She finally faced him, eyes red. "So you leave for your exile, I leave for mine. At least yours has museums."

"Sera—"

"Don't. Just... we have tonight. One night before everything changes."

That night, they held each other like drowning people. She taught him the traveler's prayer in Hebrew, her fingers tracing letters on his chest—but also showed him where she'd been wounded in the 2014 Gaza war, shrapnel scars like inverted stars.

"I might not have email access," she said into the darkness. "Or phone. For weeks."

"I know."

"If something happens—"

"Nothing will happen."

"Ethan." Her voice was steel. "Things happen. This is Israel. Things always happen."

His mother called the next morning.

"The State Department issued a warning," his mother's voice shook through WhatsApp. "They're telling Americans to leave Israel. What aren't you telling me?"

"I'm leaving tomorrow."

"Thank God. Come home."

"I'm going to Athens. Then Rome, Berlin—"

"Have you lost your mind? There were synagogue attacks in Berlin last week!"

"Mom—"

"That Israeli girl. This is about her. You're following her somewhere."

"She's being deployed, Mom. To Gaza."

Silence. Then: "Oh, sweetheart. Oh no."

Rabbi Levi's final teaching came the night before departure. They sat in his study, the maps now rolled up, replaced by a single lit candle.

"Exile is not punishment," the rabbi said. "It's spreading sparks to gather. Every place Jews have been scattered, we've left light. Now you go to gather what was scattered, to understand the dispersion that makes the return meaningful."

He handed Ethan a small mezuzah, travel-sized. "You carry Jerusalem with you. On every doorpost you pass through, remember—you're not wandering. You're gathering."

"What if I get lost?"

"You've been lost," Rabbi Levi said gently. "Now you're finding. There's a difference."

The last night with Sera, they created their own Shabbat on a Tuesday. She lit candles, he blessed wine. They ate slowly, telling stories. She gave him a small stone from the Dead Sea, smooth and dense with salt.

"To remember the lowest point," she said. "And that you can float."

"There's something else," she said in the darkness. "My unit—we're trained for tunnel warfare. Specifically."

The implications hung between them.

"Sera—"

"I need you to take something." She pressed a sealed envelope into his hand. "If I don't come back, mail this from Athens. The address is on it."

"You're coming back."

"The envelope, Ethan. Promise me."

"I promise."

She turned away. Through the window, an F-16 traced a line across the stars.

Ben Gurion Airport, 4 AM. Sera drove in uniform, her rifle in the back seat. Three checkpoints between Jerusalem and the airport—double the usual. At the second, a soldier recognized her unit insignia, saluted.

"Stay safe down there, Lieutenant."

Lieutenant. She'd never mentioned her rank.

At departures, she handed him something wrapped in newspaper—travel-sized candlesticks, replicas of his grandmother's.

"Don't be sentimental with these," she said about the candlesticks. "Use them."

Security: three hours. They swabbed everything twice. Phone inspection. The agent knew his file.

"Mr. Stone. West Bank. Twelve visits in six weeks."

"Research."

"Type?"

"Personal."

The agent marked something on his screen. "Return date?"

"Forty days."

"New visa when you come back. Clean slate." Not advice—an order.

At the gate, another check. Shin Bet this time, the investigator from Interior.

"Mr. Stone. Convenient timing."

"Tourism."

"Of course." He stepped aside. "Safe travels."

At the gate, Sera stood at attention, then broke protocol—pulled him close, whispered something in Hebrew he didn't catch. When she pulled back, her eyes were dry.

"The envelope. Athens. Don't forget."

She left without looking back. Through the window, he saw her unit's van, exhaust running.

Ethan boarded the plane to Athens. Through the window, Israel shrank to a line of coast.

His phone buzzed—Rabbi Levi: "Jeremiah 29:7."

The plane lifted off. Below, the land became a memory. Or maybe—he touched Sera's envelope in his pocket, felt the rough stone she'd given him—maybe it was becoming something else. Something he'd have to earn the right to return to.

If she was still there when he did.

If either of them were.
