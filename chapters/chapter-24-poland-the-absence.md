# Chapter 24: Poland - The Absence

At Auschwitz, the birds sang, and that was the most obscene thing of all.

Ethan stood at the gate, December morning frost making the infamous words gleam: Arbeit macht frei. Work makes free. The lie cast in iron, preserved like evidence, while sparrows chirped in nearby trees as if this were just another place, just another morning, just another lie humans told themselves to make murder feel like policy.

Tour groups gathered around him—school children with bored expressions, Americans with cameras, Israelis wrapped in flags. A young Polish guide named Magda smiled as she counted her group, her cheerfulness so incongruous that Ethan had to look away. How did anyone smile here? How did birds sing? How did the sun have the audacity to shine on ground that had swallowed so much darkness?

He separated from his assigned group, needing to walk alone through this anti-Jerusalem, this place where presence became absence, where industry perfected extinction, where his grandmother's world had been processed into smoke.

## The Weight of Numbers

The museum began with numbers. One million murdered here. Three million Polish Jews erased. Six million total. The numbers grew so large they became abstract, astronomy of annihilation, mathematics that the mind rejected like a body rejecting poison.

But then came the barracks, and the numbers became things: mountains of hair, gray and brown and blonde, some still braided as if their owners might return to reclaim them. Forty thousand pairs of shoes, some so small they could only have belonged to children who'd believed they were being relocated, resettled, renewed. Suitcases with names painted carefully on leather—the Goldbergs, the Rosenbergs, the Weinsteins—families who'd packed for journeys that ended in gas.

Ethan stopped at one suitcase, the name hitting him like physical force: R. Steinberg, painted in white letters that had survived longer than their owner. Steinberg—his grandmother's maiden name. Not necessarily his R. Steinberg, but possibly, probably, one of the many R. Steinbergs who'd thought labeling their luggage meant they'd see it again.

He found himself in a bathroom, collapsed against cold tile, his body rejecting not food but comprehension. Some things shouldn't be understood. Some things shouldn't be possible. Yet here was the evidence, methodical and preserved, the careful documentation of how a civilization dismantled itself by dismantling others.

## Birkenau's Vastness

The second camp sprawled beyond sight, barracks extending to horizons that seemed to curve with the weight of what had happened here. The railroad tracks ran straight through the gate, ending at ruins of crematoria that the Nazis had tried to destroy, as if even they knew that some evidence was too damning to leave standing.

Ethan walked the track's length, each railroad tie a heartbeat, a name, a world. Here was where the selections happened—left meant immediate death, right meant temporary slavery. Children always left. Elderly always left. Mothers who wouldn't let go of their children's hands, left. The arbitrary god of efficiency sorting humans like mail.

At the platform's end, Israeli teenagers had gathered, their voices rising in Hebrew song: "Ani ma'amin b'emunah shlemah"—I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah. Even though he delays, still I believe.

The song pulled something from Ethan's chest, words he didn't remember learning but somehow knew. He found himself singing, his voice joining theirs, this declaration of faith in the place faith died, this insistence on future in the place where futures were cremated.

"You're American?" one of the teenagers asked when the song ended.

"I don't know what I am anymore," Ethan answered, and it was the truest thing he'd said in weeks.

## Kraków's Ghosts

The Jewish Quarter of Kraków—Kazimierz—had become what Europe did with Jewish absence: a theme park. Synagogues converted to museums. "Jewish-style" restaurants serving "traditional" food to tourists seeking authenticity in a culture that existed now only in quotation marks. Hipster cafes in buildings where Torah was once chanted. Art galleries where ritual baths had been.

Ethan walked streets where 65,000 Jews had lived before the war. Now maybe 200 remained, most of them elderly, the epilogue to a thousand-year story. The absence was so present it had weight, like dark matter, invisible but bending everything around it.

In the Old Synagogue, now a museum, he found a guest book. Visitors had written messages in dozen languages, but one stopped him cold: "Looking for anyone who knew the Steinbergs from Brzeziny. I am the only one left."

Dated three months ago. No contact information. Just another ghost seeking ghosts in a city of absences.

## The Journey to Brzeziny

His grandmother's birth town lay three hours east of Kraków, past fields that looked like they'd been peaceful forever, past villages where church spires pointed toward a heaven that had been watching when the Jews were marched away.

The driver, arranged through the hotel, knew why tourists went to Brzeziny. "Nothing there," he said in broken English. "No Jews since war. You have family?"

"Had," Ethan corrected, though even that felt uncertain. How do you claim family you never knew, whose absence shaped you more than any presence could?

Brzeziny revealed itself slowly—first outlying farms, then Soviet-era apartments, finally an old town center where cobblestones remembered more than they could tell. No signs indicated Jewish history. No monuments marked absence. Just a Polish town that had been half-Jewish for five hundred years and then, in one October day in 1942, wasn't.

The church stood where the synagogue had been, its walls incorporating stones that still bore traces of Hebrew letters, palimpsest of erasure. The priest, when asked, knew nothing about Jews. "Before my time," he said, though the mezuzah marks on nearby doorframes suggested that forgetting was a choice, not chronology.

## Stanisław

Ethan found him by accident, or perhaps by that divine choreography that had been guiding him since October. An old man sitting on a bench near what had been the market square, feeding pigeons with ritualistic precision—seven pieces of bread to each bird, counting in what sounded like Hebrew numbers.

"You're Jewish," Ethan said in English, then tried the Hebrew: "Atah Yehudi?"

The man looked up with eyes that held eighty years of solitude. "I am the last," he said in accented English. "Stanisław Rosen. And you—you have Rivka Steinberg's eyes."

The world tilted. "You knew my grandmother?"

"Knew her? I loved her. We all did. Such life in her! She could make the whole shul laugh during Purim, even Rabbi Mendel who never smiled. She left in 1938 for America. The lucky ones left. The wise ones left. The rest of us..."

Stanisław stood with difficulty, his body carrying more than its own weight. "Come. You came to see what isn't here. I'll show you where it was."

## The Geography of Absence

They walked through Brzeziny's phantom geography, Stanisław narrating invisibility: "Here, the kosher butcher. There, the cheder where we learned. Your grandmother sat there"—pointing to an empty lot—"in the women's section, third row, always third row because she said she could hear better but really because she could whisper to her friend Mindel."

Each absence had specificity. Not just "Jews lived here" but "Moshe the tailor who hummed Psalm 23 while hemming." Not just "synagogue" but "where Yankel fell asleep every Shabbos and snored through the rabbi's sermon."

At a small house on Długa Street, Stanisław stopped. "Your grandmother's house. The Kowalskis live there now. Good people. They maintain the garden she planted."

The house was modest, white-washed, with windows that had watched everything and revealed nothing. In the garden, an apple tree heavy with December ice. "She planted it the year before she left," Stanisław said. "It still gives fruit. The Kowalskis bring me apples every autumn. They taste like memory."

"How did you survive?" Ethan asked.

"Hidden. The Nowaks kept me in their cellar for three years. I was nine when I went in, twelve when I came out. A different world above ground. Everyone gone. Everyone."

"Why did you stay?"

Stanisław looked at him as if the question made no sense. "Someone has to remember where things were. Someone has to say Kaddish. Someone has to be the epilogue."

## The Forest

The road to the forest was unpaved, unwanted, leading nowhere anyone wished to go. But Stanisław insisted, and Ethan followed, their feet crunching frozen leaves that had been falling on this ground for eighty Octobers since.

The clearing was unmarked except for a stone Stanisław had placed there himself in 1962, when he'd finally saved enough money. Simple Polish on one side: "Here lie 2,000 Jews of Brzeziny." Hebrew on the other: "May their memory be a blessing."

"October 15, 1942," Stanisław said. "I watched from the Nowaks' attic window. The whole town marched past. Everyone. Babies, grandmothers, the rabbi, the doctor, the fools, the wise, everyone. They made them dig. Then they shot them. Layer by layer. It took all day. The Germans were very efficient, but killing two thousand people still takes time."

The trees around the clearing stood like witnesses, their silence so complete it seemed intentional. No birds here. No wind. Nature itself holding its breath.

"Your grandmother's parents. Her brothers. Her sister Mindel. All here." Stanisław gestured at the frozen ground. "I've said Kaddish here every Friday for sixty years. Today, you say it."

Ethan began the ancient words, the Aramaic emerging as if it had been waiting in his throat since birth: "Yitgadal v'yitkadash sh'mei raba..." Magnified and sanctified be the great Name...

The wind that hadn't been blowing stopped completely. The silence deepened beyond absence of sound into presence of listening. He spoke the names he knew—Steinberg, Rosen, Goldberg—and the prayer seemed to pull more names from the ground itself, from the trees, from the ice-heavy air.

When he finished, three stars were visible in the afternoon sky. Impossible, but there—three points of light in daylight, the traditional sign that Shabbat had begun, though it was Tuesday, though it was afternoon, though nothing about this place obeyed natural law anymore.

## The Hidden Mikvah

"One more thing," Stanisław said, leading Ethan back through town to a building that looked abandoned, its windows boarded, its door hanging askew. Inside, beneath rotting floorboards, stone steps descended into darkness.

Stanisław produced a flashlight, its beam revealing carved stone, Hebrew letters, the architecture of sanctity preserved in secret. At the bottom, impossible but undeniable: water. Clear, still, reflecting their faces like memory.

"The mikvah," Stanisław said. "Ritual bath. Fed by springs. The Nazis filled it with concrete, but the springs broke through. Water always finds a way. Like memory. Like Jews."

"It's been abandoned for eighty years," Ethan said. "How is there still water?"

"How is there still a Jew in Brzeziny? How are you here, grandson of Rivka who left? Some things persist without reason."

Ethan looked at the water, his reflection fractured by flashlight beam into multiple selves—the American who'd arrived, the Jew he was becoming, the grandson returning to say goodbye.

Without planning, without thought, he walked into the mikvah fully clothed. The water was warmer than it should have been, warmer than the frozen December day above could allow. He submerged completely, the ancient words coming unbidden: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with commandments and commanded us concerning immersion."

When he emerged, Stanisław was crying. "Sixty years since anyone... Sixty years..."

## Taking Earth

At the forest clearing, as December light failed, Stanisław filled a small bag with earth. "Take them home," he said, pressing it into Ethan's hands. "They should know someone remembered. They should know their names were spoken. They should know Rivka's grandson came back to say goodbye."

The earth was frozen, black with decomposition, heavy with presence of absence. It smelled like winter, like endings, like the particular silence that follows when everything that could be said has been said.

"Will you stay here forever?" Ethan asked.

"Until I join them," Stanisław replied. "Then no one will remember where the butcher shop was. No one will know that Mindel laughed like bells. No one will say Kaddish in the forest. But you came. Rivka's grandson came. That's enough. Sometimes one witness is enough."

## Warsaw Airport

Security examined the bag of earth with suspicion. "What is this?"

"It's my family," Ethan said in Polish that came from nowhere, from the same place as the Hebrew, as the Kaddish, as the tears that hadn't stopped since the mikvah.

The guard, young enough to be his daughter, looked at his face, at his American passport, at the earth that could have concealed anything but clearly concealed everything.

"Rodzina," she said softly. Family. She sealed the bag, marked it with special tape. "No one will open this."

On the plane to Cairo—the next stop in his reverse exodus, his journey through Jewish geography of exile and return—Ethan held the bag in his lap like the child he'd never have, like the past he'd never known, like the absence that would always be more present than any presence.

He texted Sera: "I found them. I found the absence of them."

She responded with just a heart emoji. 

He understood. Some things have no words. Some absences are so complete they become their own presence. Some birds sing at Auschwitz because they don't know not to, and that ignorance is either the world's cruelty or its grace, and after walking through the geography of erasure, Ethan could no longer tell the difference.

Through the airplane window, Poland disappeared into cloud, into distance, into the kind of past that never passes. In his lap, the earth of Brzeziny weighed exactly as much as two thousand names, as one grandmother's escape, as the difference between those who left in 1938 and those who stayed until 1942, which was all the difference in the world, which was no difference at all, which was the arithmetic of accident that determined who sang Kaddish and who became Kaddish, who carried earth and who became earth.

The birds at Auschwitz sang because that's what birds do. The water in the mikvah persisted because that's what water does. Stanisław remained because someone had to. Ethan had come because someone had to. The prayer continued because prayers do that—they outlive the mouths that speak them, the ears that hear them, the God who may or may not be listening.

Memory is a kind of resistance. Forgetting is a kind of death. And sometimes, in the space between the two, an American Jew stands in a Polish forest saying Aramaic words over unmarked graves, and for a moment—just one moment—the absence becomes presence, the silence becomes speech, and two thousand voices whisper their thanks into the frozen air, saying: we were here, we mattered, we are remembered, our names are spoken, our absence is marked, our erasure is refused.

This too is Torah.

This too is testimony.

This too is truth.
