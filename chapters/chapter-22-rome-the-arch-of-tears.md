# Chapter 22: Rome - The Arch of Tears

The Arch of Titus still stood in Rome, celebrating Jerusalem's destruction, and Ethan felt two thousand years collapse into now.

November rain had cleared the Forum of tourists, leaving him alone with the monument. The marble had weathered to the color of old bones, but the relief inside the arch remained clear: Roman soldiers carrying the Temple's golden menorah—seven branches, each as tall as a man—the showbread table, the silver trumpets. SPQR carved above, Senatus Populusque Romanus, the Senate and People of Rome. Below, barely visible, someone had scratched modern Hebrew: עם ישראל חי. The people of Israel live.

Ethan stood in the exact spot where Jewish slaves had been marched through. Vespasian's inscription was still legible: IVDAEA CAPTA. Judea captured. His chest tightened, ribs pressing against something that wanted out.

"We don't walk under it."

The voice came from behind him—American accent wrestling with Italian intonations. A group of Israeli tourists had appeared despite the rain, their guide pointing at the arch with the casual authority of someone who'd given this speech a thousand times.

"Jews have never walked under the Arch of Titus. Not for two thousand years. We walk around it. Every Jew who comes to Rome, we walk around. Because they thought they destroyed us, but look—" the guide gestured at his group, teenagers mostly, draped in Israeli flags against the rain, "—we're here and the Roman Empire is a tourist attraction."

One of the teenagers started humming, then singing. The others joined: Hatikvah, in the Roman Forum. The melody rose through rain and ruins. Water streamed down Ethan's face—rain or tears, impossible to distinguish.

"You're Jewish." Not a question. The guide had approached while his group took selfies that would later appear on Instagram with captions like "We survived ✡️ #NeverAgain #AmYisraelChai."

"I'm... yes." The simple affirmation felt enormous here, under this arch, in this city that had tried to erase them.

"First time?"

"First time really understanding what it means."

The guide—Daniel, from Queens originally, made aliyah five years ago—nodded like he'd heard this before. "There's someone you should meet. Michele Della Rocca. His family has been in Rome since before the destruction. Jewish Romans who never left, not through the Empire, not through the Popes, not through Mussolini. He runs a restaurant in what used to be the ghetto. Tell him Daniel sent you. Tell him you're ready to hear the real story."

Via del Portico d'Ottavia still bore the shape of the ghetto's walls, torn down in 1870. The streets narrowed here, compressed by centuries of forced density. The Great Synagogue's aluminum dome caught the late sun—built deliberately tall in 1904, to be seen from the Vatican. A kosher bakery next to a vintage clothing store, mezuzot on some doorframes, not on others. Tourists eating at Ba'Ghetto, taking photos of the stumbling stones—brass plaques in the pavement marking where Jews were taken in 1943.

Piperno occupied the corner of Via Monte de' Cenci, the same location since 1860, the building itself from the 1500s. The walls displayed photographs: the original Pacifico Piperno, side-burns and dignity, 1890. The restaurant boarded up under racial laws, 1938. American GIs eating carciofi, 1944. Monica Bellucci at the same table, 2019.

"Daniel called. Said you stood at the arch and wept." Michele emerged from the kitchen, flour under his fingernails, oil burns on his forearms like a map of forty years at the fryer. Sixty-something, Roma football club tattoo visible under his rolled sleeve, the contradictions of a Roman Jew who cheered for the team that had fascist ultras but was still his team.

"I didn't know he—"

"Jews in Rome, we all know each other. Two thousand years in the same neighborhood, you notice who comes to look at the arch. Sit. You need to eat."

The carciofi arrived—whole artichokes deep-fried until they opened like bronze flowers. The oil had to be exactly 170 degrees Celsius, Michele had explained, watching the bubbles to know when. A Roman delicacy that most Romans didn't know was Jewish, or chose to forget.

"My family," Michele said, pouring wine that could have been blood or history or both, "we've been here since before your Jesus, before their Christ, before Rome thought it owned the world. We watched Caesar die. We watched the Popes crown themselves. We watched Mussolini march. We're still here."

"But the destruction—the Temple—"

"Yes, they destroyed the Temple. Carried its treasures through that arch you won't walk under. You know where those treasures are now?"

Ethan shook his head.

"Some say the Vatican. Hidden in their vaults with all the other things they stole in God's name. Others say the Tiber—that the menorah fell into the river during a medieval riot and waits in the mud for the Messiah to retrieve it. But you want to know what I think?"

Michele leaned forward, oil burns on his forearms catching the light.

"I think the Temple treasures are gone. Melted for coin—Romans were practical. But the real treasure got out. The presence. The Shechina. When the Romans came, it escaped. Went into exile with us. Every Jew carries a piece now. They stole our gold but not our gold. You understand?"

The restaurant filled with Thursday regulars. At the next table, two lawyers from the Court of Cassation arguing in Romanesco about a case, switching to Hebrew for the punchline of a joke. A grandmother feeding her grandson, complaining he was too thin while he showed her TikToks on his phone.

"Tomorrow," Michele said, "you come for Shabbat. But first, today, you need to see the rest. The Vatican. You need to see what they did with our God."

The Vatican felt like another planet—all that marble and gold, the accumulated wealth of centuries of convincing people that poverty was holy while building palaces for celibates. Ethan had expected to feel anger. Instead, he felt something stranger: pity mixed with recognition, like seeing a child playing with stolen toys, not understanding what they'd taken or from whom.

Father Antonio found him in the Sistine Chapel, staring at Michelangelo's Creation of Adam. The brain-shaped cloud surrounding God—Kabbalistic anatomy hidden in plain sight. On the ceiling, Aminadab wearing a yellow badge, the same badge Roman Jews would be forced to wear centuries later.

"You're looking for the Hebrew." The priest spoke English with an accent that could have been Spanish or Portuguese. Young, maybe thirty-five, wearing simple clothes despite the ornate surroundings.

"You can see it?"

"I study it. Jewish-Christian relations. The complicated history of how we became we by defining ourselves against you. My dissertation was on medieval disputations—those horrible theatrical debates where rabbis were forced to defend Judaism against charges that were designed to be unwinnable."

"And now?"

"Now I study at the Centro Pro Unione with Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni—the chief rabbi of Rome, also a radiologist, a man who reads bodies and texts with equal precision. We meet Thursday mornings. Catholics and Jews, studying what went wrong. Last week, a priest asked why we couldn't just accept Jesus as the messiah. The rabbi said, 'Look outside. Is the world redeemed?' The priest had no answer."

"Yes."

"Observant?"

"Learning to be."

Father Antonio smiled, sad and knowing. "We worship a Jew who observed Shabbat, who kept kosher, who prayed in Hebrew, and we've spent two thousand years pretending he was something else. The cognitive dissonance is spectacular."

They walked through the Museo Ebraico corridor—Jewish manuscripts the Vatican had 'preserved' during various expulsions. A Torah scroll from 1300s Trastevere. Silver spice boxes taken during the 1555 ghetto establishment. Father Antonio stopped before a marble fragment showing a menorah, inventory number 30764.

"From a Roman synagogue. First century. About the time your Temple fell. The Pope keeps saying he'll return these things, create better relations. But institutions move slowly. Especially institutions that believe they're eternal."

"Do you believe that? That the Church is eternal?"

"I believe God's relationship with the Jewish people is eternal. Everything else is interpretation."

That evening, Michele's grandmother held court at table seven, always table seven. Ninety-three, wearing Bulgari earrings—"from before," she always said, meaning before the war. She'd survived October 16, 1943, hidden in the Fatebenefratelli Hospital on Tiber Island, where Doctor Borromeo invented 'Syndrome K'—a fake contagious disease to keep Nazis from examining Jewish patients.

"I was twenty," she said in English practiced on decades of tourists. "Pretty. My Samuel fixed watches in a shop on Via Arenula—Orologi Limentani, you can still see the sign, faded but there. The Germans came at 5:30 AM, Shabbat morning. I heard them taking the Sonninos from upstairs—the baby crying, little Marco, eighteen months. Over a thousand taken. Only sixteen came back. Not Samuel. Not the Sonninos. Not little Marco."

"And after? You stayed?"

"Where would I go? This is my home. My family has been Roman longer than most Romans. You don't abandon your home because evil visits. You outlast evil. You serve artichokes to their grandchildren and remind them with every bite that we're still here."

She reached across the table, grabbed Ethan's hand with fingers that felt like living parchment.

"You're searching for something. All young Jews who come here are searching. The permission is in the persistence. We persisted. That's the miracle. Not the oil lasting eight days—that's poetry. The miracle is a grandmother in Rome serving Jewish artichokes in 2023."

Friday afternoon, Ethan helped prepare in Piperno's kitchen. Michele's family arrived in waves—his daughter from Parioli with her secular husband, his son the kosher butcher from Monteverde, cousins who ran the jewelry stores on Via del Corso. They argued about Lazio versus Roma, about the mayor's new traffic scheme, about whether cousin David's girlfriend was Jewish enough—her mother yes, but did she know the prayers? The youngest, five-year-old Sofia, sang the Four Questions in Hebrew learned at the Jewish day school on Lungotevere.

When the sun set, Michele's wife lit candles. The same words Ethan had heard in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Brooklyn, now with Roman intonation. Through the window: couples strolling on Lungotevere, the Tiber golden in twilight, beautiful and indifferent to the history it held in its mud.

"You understand now?" Michele asked after dinner, after singing, after the children had fallen asleep on couches older than nations.

"I think I'm beginning to."

"Tomorrow night, after Havdalah, go back to the arch. Different energy after Shabbat. The tourist lights will be on, making it look golden, triumphant. But you'll see what we see—a monument to a mistake. They thought they destroyed Judaism by destroying the Temple. Instead, they freed it to become global. Every synagogue is the Temple now. Every Jewish home. Every Jewish heart."

Saturday night, Ethan returned to the Forum. A Birthright group posed for photos. Two Roman Jews on dates walked wide around the arch, not even discussing it—muscle memory of avoidance. An elderly woman placed a stone at the arch's base, whispered something in Ladino—the Spanish Jews who'd fled to Rome in 1492. A young couple pushed a stroller, the baby wearing a tiny Roma jersey and a Star of David—the complications of being fully both.

A young woman started singing—an older melody, maybe Ladino, maybe older. Others joined, harmonies building. The Forum filled with Jewish voices against the lit marble.

Ethan took out his phone, photographed himself standing beyond the arch, looking back at it. Not triumphant—triumph was Roman. But present. Persistent. Alive.

He texted the photo to Sera in Jerusalem: "We won."

She responded immediately, though it was past midnight there: "No. We survived. That's better than winning. Come home."

Home. Not New York, not his apartment. Something else now.

"You returning to Israel?" Michele asked when Ethan came to say goodbye Sunday morning.

"After Berlin. My grandmother—her family was from there. I found letters. Addresses in Scheunenviertel. I need to see what's left."

Michele nodded, understanding. Behind him, Sunday morning regulars read La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, arguing about football and politics. A graffito across the street: "Romanista Ebreo"—Jewish Roma fan—not sure if it was insult or pride, probably both. He handed Ethan a package—recipe cards in his grandmother's handwriting.

"Carciofi alla giudia. The real recipe, the one my grandmother's grandmother used. For your children, when you have them. Tell them this: Rome tried to digest us but we were too tough. They broke their teeth on our persistence. Now they come to us for dinner and don't even know they're eating Jewish food. That's not revenge—Jews don't do revenge. That's survival with style."

The Frecciargento pulled away from Termini Station, past EUR's fascist architecture—Mussolini's 'Third Rome' that was supposed to rival the caesars. Now it hosted tech companies and trade shows. Through the window: umbrella pines and November light that Caravaggio would have recognized, beauty that persisted alongside everything else.

The Temple treasures were gone. But every Jew was a walking temple now.

His phone buzzed. Sera: "How was Rome?"

"Complicated. Beautiful. Painful. Alive."

"So, Jewish."

"Geography of exile or geography of persistence?"

"Same thing."

Outside the train window: Lazio becoming Tuscany, vineyards and hilltop towns, church bells marking hours that had once been marked by Temple sacrifices, would be marked by something else when Christianity joined Jupiter in the museum of former gods.

The recipes in his bag were stained with decades of oil, annotated in three languages. One note in the margin: "More salt after 1967—your grandfather's blood pressure be damned, we won the war." These small rebellions, these tiny persistences.

The train climbed through Umbria, Tuscany, toward the Alps. In four hours he'd cross into Austria, then Germany. Toward Berlin, where his grandmother's family had lived on Große Hamburger Straße before they became smoke.

Behind him, Rome continued—beautiful, eternal, complicated. The arch still stood. The Jews still stood. Both facts equally unlikely, equally true.

The train entered a tunnel through the Apennines. In the darkness, Ethan saw his reflection in the window—his face superimposed on the black, going north toward the harder history, the one without the beauty of Rome to soften it.
