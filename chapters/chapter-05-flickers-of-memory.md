# Chapter 5: Flickers of Memory

The smell hit him first—brisket and rosemary and something else, something that had no translation from childhood to now.

Friday morning, September 29th. Court Street hummed with its usual contradictions—a woman in Lululemon arguing about oat milk specifications while a homeless veteran counted change against a Citibike rack. The day before his grandmother's yahrzeit, though Ethan was trying not to think about that as he walked toward the subway, trying not to think about his mother's call, about memorial candles arriving two days too late.

But then the smell from Rosen's Bakery, unchanged since 1947 according to the sign, untouched by Brooklyn's transformation into artisanal everything—that smell reached through thirty-three years and grabbed him by the throat, by the memory, by the seven-year-old hand that had once held his grandmother's as she led him into this exact shop, though it couldn't be this exact shop, he'd grown up on Long Island, but the smell was exactly the same: challah and childhood and something sacred he'd learned to forget.

*"Eiden Israel, we get the challah for Shabbos."*

Her voice in his mind so clear he turned, expecting to see her, but there was only a Hasidic man in the corner of the coffee shop next door, davening, prayer shawl moving like wings, like time, like the grandfather Ethan had never met but whose tallit this could have been, should have been, would have been if the family hadn't sold it with everything else after his grandmother died, after the shiva Ethan hadn't attended, after the forgetting began in earnest.

His coffee tasted wrong. Burnt. Bitter. The barista had drawn a Star of David in the foam—probably meant a leaf. He'd paid $7.50 for this accident.

The Hasidic man finished his prayer, caught Ethan staring. A brief nod—acknowledgment or dismissal, Ethan couldn't tell—before turning back to his siddur.

Memory One: Friday nights, age seven, his grandmother's apartment in Kew Gardens that smelled like chicken soup and furniture polish and Europe, always Europe, though she'd been in America for forty years. The candles on her dining table, two flames that seemed enormous to his child eyes, her hands circling them three times, covering her face, whispering Hebrew that sounded like singing, like crying, like love in a language he recognized but couldn't speak.

*"Why do you cover your eyes, Grandma?"*

*"To make separate the regular from the holy. When I open, Shabbos is here."*

*"But it's just Friday night."*

*"No, bubbeleh. When we light, it becomes more."*

More. His parents would pick him up an hour later, his mother checking her watch, his father jingling car keys. Friday would become just Friday again.

Borough Hall platform, 8:47 AM. A busker played klezmer on a broken violin. Two teenagers filmed themselves dancing to it, adding trap beats through a Bluetooth speaker. Nobody else noticed the collision of centuries. Ethan found a spot near the edge, checking his phone—eighteen unread Slack messages, three texts from Aaron about coffee that he'd forgotten to answer, one notification from a dating app he'd deleted but somehow still haunted his phone like a digital dybbuk.

The train arrived already full, bodies pressed against glass like specimens in formation. He squeezed in, found himself face to face with an elderly woman, her sleeve riding up as she gripped the pole, revealing numbers tattooed on her forearm—faded blue-black, six digits that had once meant death but now meant survival, meant witness, meant everything Ethan's family had chosen not to discuss.

The numbers. Faded but visible. She caught him looking. Neither spoke. He stood, gestured to his seat. She sat. Transaction complete.

*"A dank,"* she said quietly. Thank you in Yiddish.

He nodded, not trusting his voice, not sure why his throat was closing, why his eyes were burning on a Friday morning in a subway car that smelled like coffee and desperation and now, somehow, like his grandmother's apartment, like challah under a white cloth, like wine sweeter than anything sold in stores now.

The woman's perfume—violets and age—triggered it: his bar mitzvah. Temple Beth Shalom. Phonetic Hebrew tumbling from his mouth. His grandmother in the front row, crying. Not happy tears. Something else.

*"You carry our names forward, Eiden Israel. All of them. The ones who couldn't be here."*

*"It's just a bar mitzvah, Grandma. Everyone has one."*

*"No. Not everyone. You don't know how lucky... Never mind. Dance at your party. Be happy. This is enough."*

But it wasn't enough. He could see that now, standing in the subway, holding the pole where the woman with numbers had held it, feeling the warmth of her hand still there like a blessing or a warning or both. It hadn't been enough—the phonetic Hebrew, the rented DJ, the chair they lifted him on while everyone sang songs they didn't understand. It had been a performance of Judaism, not Judaism itself. A skeleton dance, bones without flesh, tradition without transmission.

West 4th Street. Bodies shifting. Someone's elbow knocked his ribs—sharp, purposeful maybe. Through the window: gray coat, familiar walk. Not her. Never her. Dead fourteen years this September.

Memory Three: The fight. He was eleven, had brought home a C in Hebrew school. His grandmother's face—not disappointed but furious, actually furious, something he'd never seen. Weekend visits when his parents would leave him with her while they did whatever adults did with their freedom—errands, probably, or just driving in silence, grateful for the break from performing family.

*"You think this is a game? You think Hebrew is just another subject like geography?"*

She'd slammed her palm on the kitchen table. The challah dough jumped.

*"My father would have given anything—ANYTHING—for you to have this chance to learn. And you sit there with your video games, making mockery?"*

*"Grandma, I—"*

*"No. You don't 'Grandma' me. You know what happened to boys who couldn't learn Hebrew where I come from? They learned it anyway. In cellars. In forests. While running. And you can't be bothered in a classroom with snacks?"*

His mother had intervened then, keys jangling. *"Mom, he's just a kid."*

*"So were we all. Just kids."*

The anger had drained from her then, leaving something worse—a terrible tiredness. She'd looked at him like she was seeing through him to some future where everything was forgotten.

Spring Street station smelled of piss and fresh bread from the bakery above. Strange combination. Everything in this city a contradiction. He climbed toward daylight. Behind him, conversation fragments:

*"She's sitting shiva for her mother."*

*"What's shiva?"*

*"Jewish thing. Seven days of mourning."*

*"Seven days? My therapist says grief should be processed and released."*

*"Yeah, well."*

The 10 AM standup would start without him.

Broome Street. Synagogue doors open. Men hauling out a bench—wood so old it looked soft, like you could push your thumb through it. The eternal light flickered. Bad wiring or divine commentary.

The Torah scrolls passed through the congregation. Age nine, High Holidays. Everyone reaching out. His grandmother pushing him forward. Her grip too tight, leaving marks on his shoulder.

*"Touch it, bubbeleh. This is yours too."*

He'd pulled back. The rabbi passed. Her hand loosened.

*"It's okay. Maybe next year."*

Next year: bathroom. Year after: stopped going. Year after: dead.

Spring Street led to Bowery led to wandering without destination, his phone buzzing with work messages he didn't answer, with the world demanding his attention while his attention was somewhere else, somewhen else, in a past that was suddenly more present than the present, more real than the artisanal coffee shops and vintage clothing stores and all the carefully curated nothing that had replaced whatever used to be here.

Memory Five: Disturbing. Age eight, finding her crying in the bathroom at Thanksgiving. Not gentle tears—ugly, body-shaking sobs. She was holding a photograph he'd never seen before: three children in matching sailor suits.

*"Grandma?"*

She'd startled, tried to hide the photo. Too late. He'd seen the yellow stars on their coats.

*"My brothers. My sister."*

*"Where are they?"*

The look she gave him—not sad, not protective. Empty. Like looking into a room where all the furniture had been removed.

*"Gone. Go play, Eiden."*

He'd backed away, left her there. Never asked again. Never saw the photo again. But sometimes caught her looking at him with that same empty expression, like she was seeing through him to those other children, the ones in sailor suits, the ones who didn't get to grow up and forget.

Outside a Chase bank on Houston Street. A security guard was arguing with a man holding a cardboard sign: "Jewish. Hungry. Today is still today." The guard kept saying "Move along," but the man just stood there, davening slightly, sign swaying like he was at sea.

Hebrew singing from somewhere. A food truck, actually—"Moishe's Kosher Tacos"—the owner singing along to Israeli radio while assembling orders. Strange collision: *Hava Nagila* mixed with diesel exhaust and cilantro.

Shanghai, 1941—no, he'd never been. But the candlesticks had. She'd told him once, just once, offhand while polishing them. Thursday night ritual. *"These saw more than silver should see."* Wouldn't elaborate. Changed the subject to his math homework. Now they sat in his closet. Tissue paper coffin.

*"These were my mother's. And her mother's. And now..."*

*"Grandma, I don't even light Shabbat candles."*

*"Not now. But someday, maybe. And if not you, then maybe your children. Someone will need them. Someone will remember."*

Someone will remember. But no one had. The candlesticks were in his closet, had been through three apartment moves, wrapped in the same yellowed tissue paper, behind shoes he never wore and jackets he'd forgotten he owned, buried under the sediment of a life lived on the surface while everything deep stayed dark.

11:47 AM. Phone buzzing: Marcus from work. "Bro, where are you? Davidson's looking for blood."

Another text: "Coverage meeting at 2. They're talking about 'restructuring.'"

Another: "Nevermind, I told them you had food poisoning."

Food poisoning. Not wrong, exactly. He'd been poisoned by something.

Great Neck Assisted Living, September 2009. Sophomore year. She'd shrunk—not just height but presence. Density. Like something essential had been extracted.

*"It's just Ethan, Grandma."*

*"Names don't just disappear, Eiden."*

*"I go by Ethan now."*

*"You go. But where?"*

Two weeks later: dead. Her yahrzeit candle burning illegal in the facility. Twenty-four hours before staff noticed. Small rebellion. Last light.

Delancey Street. Two Orthodox boys, maybe ten years old, arguing about Pokemon cards.

*"Charizard is obviously stronger."*

*"Nu? But Mewtwo has psychic damage."*

*"My zeyde says Pokemon is avodah zarah."*

*"Your zeyde says everything is avodah zarah."*

They noticed Ethan watching, went quiet, hurried past. Thirty-seven missed Slack messages now.

No. That math was wrong. His grandmother had fled in 1939. It had been eighty-four years. But thirty-seven was still there, insisting on itself, demanding attention, meaning something he couldn't decode because he'd never learned the language of numbers that mattered, only the ones that measured engagement metrics and conversion rates and all the contemporary arithmetic of emptiness.

The wind carried that Hebrew melody again, closer now, and he realized it was coming from his own throat—he was humming it, had been humming it for blocks without noticing, his body remembering what his mind had forgotten, his vocal cords carrying a tune his grandmother had sung while cooking, while cleaning, while dying, probably, though he hadn't been there to hear it.

*"Shabbat shalom, Shabbat sha—"*

Lyrics gone. Muscle memory without meaning. He knew there were more verses, more words, but they were gone, erased by years of not singing them, not hearing them, not being in places where they were sung. His grandmother had tried to teach him, Friday after Friday, but he'd been more interested in television, in video games, in anything but the ancient songs that embarrassed him with their foreign sounds, their minor keys, their insistence on memory when all he'd wanted was to forget he was different, to forget he was connected to something older than America, older than success, older than the careful assimilation his parents had worked so hard to achieve.

Home. The door stuck—humidity swelling the wood. He had to shoulder it open, three attempts, each more violent. The Thai container had leaked overnight, sweet sauce pooling on his coffee table like evidence of a life lived alone. Through his window: his neighbor's kid practicing violin. Scales. Wrong notes. Starting over. Wrong notes. Starting over.

The closet door hadn't been opened in months. Stuck too. Everything in this apartment resisting. He yanked. Something fell—his college diploma, glass cracked diagonal across "Bachelor of Arts." He kicked it aside, kept digging. Past running shoes worn twice. Past the jacket from his failed startup. Past the Patagonia vest every tech worker owned like a uniform of belonging.

The tissue paper crumbled at his touch. Forty years of waiting had made it brittle. Like dried skin. Like old letters. Like his grandmother's hands the last time he'd held them. The candlesticks inside: tarnished black where the silver met air, one base dented (when? how? stories he'd never know), heavier than memory. They smelled of metal and age and his grandmother's apartment—that specific mixture of Murphy's oil soap and boiled chicken and fear never quite scrubbed away.

Kitchen counter. He set them next to his Nespresso machine. One wobbled—uneven base. Had it always? In the overhead light, he could see scratches in the silver. Hebrew letters? No—just scratches. Random damage from decades of Friday nights. Or maybe from the journey: Poland to Shanghai to New York. Hidden in flour sacks, she'd said. But flour sacks where? In whose kitchen? Carried by whose hands before hers?

He didn't have candles. Of course he didn't. His mother's Amazon order wouldn't arrive until Sunday. The yahrzeit would pass unmarked except by this—by holding the candlesticks, by remembering seven memories that were really one memory repeated in different keys, the memory of being loved in a language he'd refused to learn, of being claimed by a tradition he'd tried to escape, of being named Israel whether he used it or not.

The street lights outside his window flickered—once, twice, seven times—like someone was signaling, like the universe was trying to tell him something in morse code, in light and darkness, in the language God used on the first day when everything was void and without form until the words were spoken: Let there be light.

No candles. Of course not. He checked anyway—junk drawer, under sink, bathroom cabinet. Birthday candles from two years ago, bent and probably used. A lavender aromatherapy candle from an ex. Nothing that fit. Nothing that belonged.

Outside: Brooklyn's Friday night beginning. Sirens. Music from three different sources. Someone rolling a shopping cart with one broken wheel—rhythmic squeaking like a question asked over and over.

The candlesticks caught the last light of day coming through his window, threw shadows on his wall that looked like Hebrew letters, like his grandmother's handwriting, like all the prayers he'd never learned spelling themselves out in darkness and light, waiting for someone who could read them, waiting for tomorrow's yahrzeit, waiting for Amazon Prime to deliver what had already been delivered but not received, given but not taken, offered but not accepted.

From the apartment below: a child's voice. *"Mommy, why do we light candles?"*

Muffled response. Then louder: *"Because Bubbe did."*

*"But why did Bubbe?"*

Silence. Or an answer too quiet to hear through floors.

Ethan's candlesticks stood empty on his counter. Waiting. The dented one caught the streetlight, threw a small bright spot on his ceiling. Like a star. Like an eye. Like the first point of light before creation, when everything was void and without form, when the only choice was whether to begin.
