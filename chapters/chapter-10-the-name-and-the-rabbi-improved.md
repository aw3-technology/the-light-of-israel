# Chapter 10: The Name and the Rabbi

The building at 541 West 77th Street looked like any other Upper West Side brownstone. Tuesday evening, mid-October. Ethan had walked past three times before stopping.

First pass: just walking, thinking. Another day of optimization meetings where he'd spoken fluent corporate while Friday's Shabbat service replayed in his mind.

Second pass: checking the card—Rabbi Levi Ben-David, Tuesday Evening Learning, All Levels Welcome. The last line underlined in blue ink.

Third pass: standing at the base of a narrow flight of stairs. The mezuzah on the doorframe caught dying light.

The door opened before he knocked.

"I thought that was you." The secretary, silver-haired with amused eyes. "Third time's the charm. Though in Hebrew, three times makes a chazakah—permanence."

"I wasn't—I was just—"

"Walking. Rabbi Levi mentioned you might walk by. He has a gift for knowing when someone's circling." She glanced at her watch. "He's finishing with another student. Tea?"

The waiting room was everything his startup wasn't—worn floors that creaked, walls lined with photographs of rabbis whose eyes measured time differently. A radiator clanked somewhere.

"Sugar?" Russian-style tea in a metal holder.

A door opened. A young woman emerged, looking like she'd been crying but relieved. She nodded at the secretary, glanced at Ethan with fellow-traveler solidarity.

"You can go in."

The study door stood ajar, warm light spilling out.

"Shalom, Ethan Israel Stone."

The words hit like recognition, like coming home to find someone keeping the lights on. Rabbi Levi Ben-David stood from behind a desk older than America, showing no surprise at Ethan's shock.

"How did you—nobody knows my middle name."

"Your grandmother Rivka knew it. Spoke it often." The rabbi was younger than expected, maybe fifty, beard more pepper than salt, eyes like libraries. "She was my teacher's student in Brooklyn. Before the Parkinson's."

Ethan felt something crack inside—fear, maybe relief. "She talked about me?"

"To everyone who would listen. 'My Ethan,' she'd say. Said you had a Jewish soul in exile from itself."

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves rose like walls of compressed wisdom. The rabbi gestured to a worn chair.

"But someone must've told you..."

"You think I'm performing magic tricks?" Rabbi Levi poured tea from a samovar.

"I'm not religious."

"Neither was Moses when the bush caught fire." He cleaned his glasses, missed a spot, gave up. His phone buzzed again—he glanced at it irritably. "What brought you here?"

"October 7th."

"No. October 7th woke something. You can't wake what isn't there. What was already there?"

The radiator clanked. 

"I don't know who I am."

Silence. Rabbi Levi let it stretch, let the words find their weight.

"Good." The rabbi cleaned his glasses, considering. "Most people think they know. It prevents becoming."

The rabbi pulled a taped-together volume from the shelf. "Your depression. I can see it. Keep taking medication if you're on it."

"How do you—"

"Half my congregants are medicated. Including me." He paused. "Sometimes it's grief for a self we've never met."

A book slipped from a shelf—pages fluttering open. The Zohar, landing spine-up between them. The radiator kicked on with a shudder.

Ethan glanced between the book and the vent. "Did the radiator—?"

Rabbi Levi shrugged, bending to retrieve it. "Old building. Things shift." But his eyes held a question too.

"You're making me nervous standing there like you might bolt."

Ethan sat. The chair embraced him like it had been waiting.

"Thursday." The rabbi handed him a photocopied page. Psalm 137. By the rivers of Babylon.

Ethan glanced from the shelves to his phone. "It feels like a system."

"It is." His phone buzzed. He glanced, silenced it.

Through the door, footsteps—another student waiting.

"Come back Thursday. We'll study properly then."

"My grandmother—she really talked about me?"

Rabbi Levi's expression softened. "Your Hebrew name, especially. Made it sound like a prayer. Your grandmother connected to the divine through speaking your name."

Outside, October had turned properly cold. The stairs down felt different—not descent but integration.

The N train came immediately. Nearly empty except for an elderly Black woman reading Hebrew, Koren edition with commentary.

She noticed his psalm page. "Good choice—that one stays with you." She smiled, returned to her reading.

At 14th Street, she stood. "Shabbat shalom," she said softly.

His apartment looked the same but felt different. The candlesticks sat waiting on the dining table, tarnished silver ready to hold light.

He set the psalm beside them, Hebrew letters mysterious but insistent.

His phone buzzed. Aaron: "Where are you? Missing trivia night."

"Can't make it."

"Everything okay?"

He looked at the psalm, the candlesticks, his reflection in the dark window—himself but different. More himself than three hours ago.

Ethan selected his Thursday meetings, clicked decline.

"Israel," he whispered. First time in twenty years.

His phone buzzed—Aaron again. The sound fractured the moment, but something had shifted. He looked at the psalm, the candlesticks.

He set the psalm beside the candlesticks and whispered his name again.

"Israel."
