# Chapter 10: The Name and the Rabbi

The building at 541 West 77th Street looked like any other Upper West Side brownstone. Tuesday evening, mid-October. Ethan had walked past three times before stopping.

First pass: just walking, thinking. Another day of optimization meetings where he'd spoken fluent corporate while Friday's Shabbat service replayed in his mind.

Second pass: checking the card—Rabbi Levi Ben-David, Tuesday Evening Learning, All Levels Welcome. The last line underlined in blue ink.

Third pass: standing at the base of a narrow flight of stairs. The mezuzah on the doorframe caught dying light.

The door opened before he knocked.

"I thought that was you." The secretary, silver-haired with amused eyes. "Third time's the charm. Though in Hebrew, three times makes a chazakah—permanence."

"I wasn't—I was just—"

"Walking. Rabbi Levi mentioned you might walk by. He has a gift for knowing when someone's circling." She glanced at her watch. "He's finishing with another student. Tea?"

The waiting room was everything his startup wasn't—worn floors that creaked, walls lined with photographs of rabbis whose eyes measured time differently. A radiator clanked somewhere.

"Sugar?" Russian-style tea in a metal holder.

A door opened. A young woman emerged, looking like she'd been crying but relieved. She nodded at the secretary, glanced at Ethan with fellow-traveler solidarity.

"You can go in."

The study door stood ajar, warm light spilling out.

"Shalom, Ethan Israel Stone."

The words hit like recognition, like coming home to find someone keeping the lights on. Rabbi Levi Ben-David stood from behind a desk older than America, showing no surprise at Ethan's shock.

"How did you—my middle name. Nobody knows—"

"Your grandmother Rivka knew it. Spoke it often." The rabbi was younger than expected, maybe fifty, beard more pepper than salt, eyes like libraries. "She was my teacher's student in Brooklyn. Before the Parkinson's."

Ethan felt something crack inside—fear, maybe relief. "She talked about me?"

"To everyone who would listen. 'My Ethan,' she'd say. Said you had a Jewish soul in exile from itself."

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves rose like walls of compressed wisdom. The rabbi gestured to a worn chair.

"But that could be—I mean, anyone could have told you. The secretary, someone at the synagogue—"

"You think I'm performing magic tricks?" Rabbi Levi poured tea from a samovar, wincing as he settled into his chair. "Old back injury. Wrestling. Actual wrestling, not the metaphorical kind."

"I'm not religious."

"Neither was Moses when the bush caught fire." He cleaned his glasses, missed a spot, tried again. "What brought you here?"

"October 7th."

"No. October 7th woke something. You can't wake what isn't there. What was already there?"

The radiator clanked. The books seemed to lean in.

"I don't know who I am."

Ethan's voice cracked on the admission. Three years of therapy, he'd never said it that simply. I don't know who I am. The words hung in air thick with dust and possibility.

"Good. Most people think they know, which prevents them from becoming. Not knowing is wisdom's beginning. Socrates said that—probably stole it from the Jews."

The rabbi pulled a taped-together volume from the shelf. "Your depression. And yes, I can see it. Keep taking medication if you're on it. Sometimes depression is the soul in exile from itself."

"How do you—"

"Know that look? Half my congregants are medicated. Including me. Sertraline, ten years. Sometimes what feels like depression is grief for a self we've never met."

A book fell from a shelf—actually fell, pages fluttering open. The Zohar, landing spine-up between them.

Ethan stared. "Books don't just—"

"Fall? No, they don't." Rabbi Levi made no move to pick it up. "But this room has its own weather."

Or maybe the shelf was overpacked. Maybe someone had pulled adjacent volumes recently, disturbing the balance. Maybe the building's foundations shifted with October's temperature change. Ethan wanted a rational explanation almost as much as he feared one.

"You're making me nervous standing there like you might bolt."

Ethan sat. The chair embraced him like it had been waiting.

"Read this Thursday." The rabbi handed him a photocopied page. Psalm 137. By the rivers of Babylon. "Don't try to understand. Just let it speak."

Ethan glanced from the shelves to his phone. "It feels like a system."

The rabbi smiled. "Torah and software—both are systems for processing reality." His phone buzzed. He glanced, frowned. "My daughter. Crisis about her bat mitzvah portion. Sixteen texts about whether Leviticus relates to climate change."

Through the door, footsteps—another student waiting.

"Come back Thursday. We'll study properly then."

"My grandmother—she really talked about me?"

Rabbi Levi's expression softened. "Your Hebrew name, especially. Made it sound like a prayer. Your grandmother connected to the divine through speaking your name."

Outside, October had turned properly cold. The thirty-six steps down felt different—not descent but integration.

The N train came immediately. Nearly empty except for an elderly Black woman reading Hebrew, Koren edition with commentary.

She looked up. "You've been to see the rabbi."

"How did you—"

"That look. Scrambled but settling. He's good, Rabbi Levi. Forty years ago, converting, everyone said a Black woman had no business with Torah. He said Torah had business with me."

At 14th Street, she stood. "That paper in your pocket—Psalm 137. My first assignment too. Still makes me cry. The good kind."

His apartment looked the same but felt different. The candlesticks sat waiting on the dining table, tarnished silver ready to hold light.

He set the psalm beside them, Hebrew letters mysterious but insistent.

His phone buzzed. Aaron: "Dude, where are you? $5 wells until 9."

"Can't make it. Something came up."

"What could possibly come up on a Tuesday?"

He looked at the psalm, the candlesticks, his reflection in the dark window—himself but different. More himself than three hours ago.

Ethan selected his Thursday meetings, clicked decline.

"Israel," he said aloud. First time in twenty years.

The sound of it like coming home to a place he'd never been.

The radiator clanked its own rhythm. Somewhere uptown, a rabbi in a study where books fell at odd moments waited patiently for Thursday. For the rivers of Babylon to do their work. For Ethan Israel Stone to remember what he'd never really forgotten.

Just hidden. Like light. Like his name. Like the way home.
