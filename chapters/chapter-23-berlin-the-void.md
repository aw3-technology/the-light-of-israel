# Chapter 23: Berlin - The Void

The Jewish Museum's void stretched three stories of empty space, and Ethan heard his grandmother's silence echo.

April 2024, nearly Passover. Berlin spreading gray beneath a sky that couldn't decide between rain and snow. The void—architect Libeskind called it that, literally—rose through the museum like a throat that had screamed itself empty, concrete walls at angles that hurt to perceive.

Ethan gripped the safety rail, knuckles white. Below: nothing. Above: nothing. The space where Jewish Berlin had been deleted.

"You're American?"

A guard—young, trained to watch for people who stood too long at edges.

"I don't know anymore."

"Museum closes in one hour."

An hour to understand the incomprehensible. How Berlin could be both Beethoven and Buchenwald. The Wannsee Conference where fifteen men had lunched—soup, chicken, potatoes, wine.

Outside, Thursday afternoon Berlin: cyclists, outdoor cafés despite the cold, construction cranes building futures on ground that would never be clean. Platform 17 at Grunewald station. The S-Bahn carried commuters now, same trains that had carried Jews to collection points.

The platform's inscriptions: "October 18, 1941: 1,089 Jews to Łódź. October 24, 1941: 896 Jews to Łódź."

Each number a person with a suitcase, a coat, hope that Łódź meant resettlement.

Third panel: "December 9, 1942: 994 Jews to Auschwitz."

His grandmother's family name in the archives. Transport 46.

"You are researching family?"

An elderly woman, German accent but Jewish cadence. She leaned on a walker, each movement calculated to conserve energy.

"My grandmother's cousins. December transport."

"Ah. Winter transports." She shifted weight, winced. "No heat. Many died before arrival. Perhaps a mercy."

"I am Hannah Weiss."

He recognized the name—survivor, author, the woman who'd returned to Berlin in 1950.

"Why did you come back?"

"Someone had to be the Jewish presence in the absence." She adjusted her hearing aid with trembling fingers. "Make them see us every day. My existence is their failure."

Her apartment in Charlottenburg. Same building from her childhood. She moved slowly, counting pills into a weekly organizer—heart medication, blood pressure, the pharmacy of survival. The furniture modern but the walls remembered.

"Your grandmother, from Poland? The Polish Jews who came to Berlin, very sophisticated. They thought Germany meant culture." She knocked over her tea reaching for sugar. "Scheiße. My hands..." Ethan helped clean up. She waved him away, irritated. "No, leave it. I can—well, maybe not. Thank you. Where was I? Oh yes, culture. They loved Wagner. Can you imagine? Wagner!"

"Do you hate them? The Germans?"

"Hate is simple. I feel—" She paused, struggled with a jar of jam, her arthritis making her fingers useless. "This stupid jar. My neighbor opens them for me. Nice woman. Her grandfather was SS. We don't discuss it." She gave up on the jar. "Every time I buy bread, I represent six million dead. Exhausting. Also the bread here is terrible. Have you tried the pumpernickel?"

Her arm showed numbers, faded but visible.

"October 7th." She stared at nothing. "You want to know if it's the same. It's not—well, maybe. No. It's the rhyme. History doesn't repeat, it rhymes. Kill the Jews. Always the same poem, different verses."

Outside, Berlin's December darkness. This apartment had been Aryanized, this street renamed. Hannah had survived on potatoes and the promise of return. 

"Sometimes I dream I'm still in that basement," she said, then stopped. "No, that's not true. I dream of other things. Normal things. Missing the U-Bahn. But I wake up thinking I smell them—his cigarettes, her cabbage soup. The couple who hid me." She rubbed her wrists. "I still eat too fast. Still hide food. Yogurt behind books. Crackers—" She laughed suddenly. "Last week I found a sandwich in my winter coat from 1987. Petrified. A museum piece."

She wrote down a guide's name for Auschwitz, her handwriting shaky. Crossed it out, wrote another. "No, he died. Use this one." She took her evening pills, miscounted, started over, gave up. "Close enough. Getting old is also—what was I saying? Oh yes, revenge. They wanted me dead at fourteen. I'm ninety-three and still buying their terrible bread."

That night, sleepless, Ethan walked Berlin. Found himself at the Holocaust Memorial—2,711 concrete slabs. Earlier, children had played on them while parents took photos. Now: empty, honest.

His phone buzzed. David, Israeli in Berlin: "Hannah gave me your number. Want to meet? Show you the real Jewish Berlin?"

Next morning, a café in Mitte where young Israelis clustered. David: twenty-eight, designer clothes, tech startup confidence. Around them, Hebrew conversations, Tel Aviv accents. A woman at the next table worked on her laptop, IDF service pin on her bag.

"Berlin is freedom," David said. "No rockets, no reserve duty, no—"

"Built on Jewish graves."

"Everything is built on graves. Tel Aviv on Palestinian villages. The question is what you build."

"And what is Berlin building?"

"The future. Look around—" He gestured at the café full of young Jews. "Israelis, Americans, even some Germans converting. There's a Purim party next week. Three hundred people expected. Jewish Berlin is alive."

"With armed guards."

David's enthusiasm cracked slightly. "Since October 7th, yes. Doubled security. My neighbor—sweet German girl—asked if I felt 'responsible' for Gaza." He laughed bitterly. "I told her my grandparents were from Iraq. The Farhud. She didn't know what that was."

Two women entered speaking Hebrew, kissed David on both cheeks. One wore a Magen David necklace openly. The other had a tattoo in Hebrew: "To live is to resist."

"You see?" David said. "We're not hiding."

"Yet."

That afternoon: Wannsee. The villa where fifteen men had designed hell. The lake was beautiful—families sailing where genocide had been engineered. Ethan's stomach cramped, sharp pain climbing his ribs. He vomited beside roses, bile and the morning's coffee.

A guard offered water. "Are you ill?"

"I'm Jewish."

As if that explained the vomiting, the chest pain, the way his hands shook uncontrollably.

That night, his grandmother's yahrzeit. December 2nd. A tea light from the hotel lobby. He said Kaddish from his phone, the prayer that never mentioned death but sanctified God's name despite everything.

The candle flame reflected in the window. His body ached—shoulders, jaw. He'd been grinding his teeth, noticed blood on his pillow that morning.

Family names from the databases:
- Ruchel Steinberg, Auschwitz, 1942
- Her children: Sarah (6), David (4), Miriam (18 months)

Morning. Platform 17 before dawn. He placed twenty-three stones, one for each murdered family member. His hands trembled—cold or something else. The tremor had started in Berlin, grown worse each day.

The 7:18 to Kraków. Through Oświęcim, which the Germans had renamed Auschwitz. He boarded with his single bag, notebook, phone with its databases. His chest tight, that same climbing pain.

Text from his mother: "Are you okay?"
Text from Aaron: "Where the fuck are you?"
Text from David: "Purim party Thursday. You should come back."

He turned off his phone. If he stopped now, the silence would swallow him too. Polish countryside blurred past. His reflection in the window: pale, hollow-eyed. When had he last eaten? The tremor in his hands visible even at rest.

Ahead: Auschwitz.
Behind: Berlin where Hannah counted pills and hid yogurt.
Between: Ethan Israel Stone, carrying stones, carrying names, carrying what refused to be forgotten.

Oświęcim station.
The train stopped.
His body wanted to run.
The silence pressed at his back.
His legs carried him forward.
