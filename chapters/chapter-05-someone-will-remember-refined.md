# Chapter 5: Someone Will Remember

The smell hit him first—brisket and rosemary and something untranslatable between then and now.

Friday morning, October 6th. Court Street hummed with its usual contradictions—a woman in Lululemon arguing about oat milk specifications while a homeless veteran counted change against a Citibike rack. The day before his grandmother's yahrzeit, though Ethan was trying not to think about that as he walked toward the subway.

But then the smell from Rosen's Bakery, unchanged since 1947 according to the sign—that smell reached across thirty-three years and caught in his throat, in the seven-year-old hand that had once held his grandmother's as she led him into this exact shop, though it couldn't be this exact shop, he'd grown up on Long Island, but the smell was exactly the same: challah and childhood and something sacred he'd learned to forget.

*"Ethan Israel, we get the challah for Shabbos."*

Her voice in his mind so clear he turned, expecting to see her. But there was only his reflection in the bakery window.

His coffee tasted wrong. The barista had drawn something in the foam—a leaf, maybe. $7.50 for coffee that reminded him of nothing.

Memory: Friday nights, age seven, his grandmother's apartment in Kew Gardens that smelled like chicken soup and furniture polish and Europe. The candles on her dining table, two flames that seemed enormous to his child eyes, her hands circling them three times, covering her face, whispering Hebrew that sounded like singing.

*"Why do you cover your eyes, Grandma?"*

*"To make separate the regular from the holy. When I open, Shabbos is here."*

*"But it's just Friday night."*

*"No, bubbeleh. When we light, it becomes more."*

More. His parents would pick him up an hour later, his mother checking her watch, his father jingling car keys. Friday would become just Friday again.

Borough Hall platform. A busker played something on violin—maybe klezmer, maybe just broken. 

The train arrived already full. He squeezed in, found himself face to face with an elderly woman, her sleeve riding up as she gripped the pole, revealing numbers tattooed on her forearm—faded blue-black, six digits. She caught him looking. He stood, gestured to his seat. She sat.

*"A dank,"* she said quietly. Thank you in Yiddish.

He nodded, not trusting his voice.

The woman's perfume—violets and age—triggered it: his bar mitzvah. Temple Beth Shalom. Phonetic Hebrew tumbling from his mouth. His grandmother in the front row, crying. Not happy tears.

*"You did good up there, bubbeleh. Your Hebrew, not so bad."*

*"It's just a bar mitzvah, Grandma. Everyone has one."*

*"Everyone?"* Her voice got quiet. *"You think everyone gets to stand up there, to read from the Torah in broad daylight?" She adjusted his tie. "You don't know. But that's okay. Dance at your party. Eat too much cake. This is what we wanted."*

But it wasn't enough. He could see that now, standing in the subway, holding the pole where the woman with numbers had held it.

West 4th Street. Bodies shifting. Through the window: gray coat, familiar walk. Not her. Never her. Dead fourteen years ago this September.


Spring Street station. He climbed toward daylight. Behind him, conversation fragments:

*"She's sitting shiva for her mother."*

*"What's shiva?"*

*"Jewish thing. Seven days of mourning."*

The 10 AM standup would start without him. Third time this week. Marcus would notice—had already pulled him aside Tuesday about his "engagement levels." As if grief could be scheduled around sprint planning.

Broome Street. His phone buzzed again—probably the standup meeting wondering where he was. He ignored it.


Age eight, Thanksgiving. He'd found her crying in the bathroom. She held a photograph: three children in sailor suits with yellow stars on their coats.

*"My brothers. My sister."*

*"Where are they?"*

The look she gave him. Empty.

*"Gone."*

He'd never seen the photo again.

Houston Street. His phone buzzed a third time. Rachel, maybe? He'd texted her Tuesday, no response. The meeting would be over by now anyway.


*"These were my mother's. And her mother's. Heavy, no? Feel how heavy."*

*"Grandma, I don't even light Shabbat candles."*

*"So? You think I always lit candles? In Shanghai, we had no candles. We used cooking oil, little wicks made from shoelaces." She laughed, not happily. "God doesn't care about perfect candles, bubbeleh. God cares that someone tries."*

Someone will remember. The candlesticks were in his closet, wrapped in yellowed tissue paper.

His phone buzzed. Work. He didn't look.


Delancey Street. A melody caught in his throat—he was humming something, had been humming for blocks without noticing.

*"Shabbat shalom, Shabbat sha—"*

The lyrics were gone. His grandmother had tried to teach him, Friday after Friday, but he'd been more interested in television.

Home. The door stuck. The Thai container had leaked overnight. Through his window: his neighbor's kid practicing violin. Wrong notes. Starting over.

The closet door was stuck. He yanked it open. Behind shoes and jackets he'd forgotten about, the tissue paper from his grandmother's things.

The tissue paper crumbled at his touch—forty years of waiting had made it brittle. The candlesticks inside: tarnished black, one base dented, heavier than he remembered. They smelled of metal and age and his grandmother's apartment—Murphy's oil soap and boiled chicken and something else she'd never been able to scrub away.

He set them on the kitchen counter next to his coffee maker. One wobbled—the dented base. In the overhead light, scratches in the silver looked almost like Hebrew letters. Almost.

No candles. He checked the junk drawer anyway—birthday candles from years ago, a lavender aromatherapy candle from an ex. Nothing that belonged.

Outside, Brooklyn's Friday night was beginning. Through the walls, that Hebrew melody again, clearer now. A child's voice joining in, learning the words.

From somewhere below: a child's voice. *"Mommy, why do we light candles?"*

Muffled response: *"Because Bubbe did."*

*"But why did Bubbe?"*

Silence. Or an answer too quiet to hear.

Ethan stood in his kitchen, holding his grandmother's candlesticks. Empty, waiting. He opened the drawer, found matches left from winter blackouts. Struck one. The flame caught, steady and warm.

He held it over the candlestick, watching wax begin to pool in the base from some long-ago candle. The flame danced, reflected in the tarnished silver—two lights where there was one.

Then blew it out.

The smell of sulfur faded. The candlesticks remained on the counter. He didn't put them away. Tomorrow was his grandmother's yahrzeit. They could wait one more day.

Outside, that child's voice again, learning the Shabbat melody. Getting the words wrong, starting over. Learning.
