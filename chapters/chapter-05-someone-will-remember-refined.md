# Chapter 5: Someone Will Remember

The smell hit him first—brisket and rosemary and something untranslatable between then and now.

Friday morning, October 6th. Court Street hummed with its usual contradictions—a woman in Lululemon arguing about oat milk specifications while a homeless veteran counted change against a Citibike rack. The day before his grandmother's yahrzeit, though Ethan was trying not to think about that as he walked toward the subway.

But then the smell from Rosen's Bakery, unchanged since 1947 according to the sign—that smell reached across thirty-three years and caught in his throat, in the seven-year-old hand that had once held his grandmother's as she led him into this exact shop, though it couldn't be this exact shop, he'd grown up on Long Island, but the smell was exactly the same: challah and childhood and something sacred he'd learned to forget.

*"Ethan Israel, we get the challah for Shabbos."*

Her voice in his mind so clear he turned, expecting to see her, but there was only a Hasidic man in the corner of the coffee shop next door, davening, prayer shawl moving like wings.

His coffee tasted wrong. The barista had drawn a Star of David in the foam—probably meant a leaf. $7.50 for the accident.

The Hasidic man finished his prayer, caught Ethan staring. A brief nod before turning back to his siddur.

Memory: Friday nights, age seven, his grandmother's apartment in Kew Gardens that smelled like chicken soup and furniture polish and Europe. The candles on her dining table, two flames that seemed enormous to his child eyes, her hands circling them three times, covering her face, whispering Hebrew that sounded like singing.

*"Why do you cover your eyes, Grandma?"*

*"To make separate the regular from the holy. When I open, Shabbos is here."*

*"But it's just Friday night."*

*"No, bubbeleh. When we light, it becomes more."*

More. His parents would pick him up an hour later, his mother checking her watch, his father jingling car keys. Friday would become just Friday again.

Borough Hall platform. A busker played klezmer on a broken violin. Two teenagers filmed themselves dancing to it, adding trap beats through a Bluetooth speaker. Almost nobody noticed the collision of centuries. 

The train arrived already full. He squeezed in, found himself face to face with an elderly woman, her sleeve riding up as she gripped the pole, revealing numbers tattooed on her forearm—faded blue-black, six digits. She caught him looking. He stood, gestured to his seat. She sat.

*"A dank,"* she said quietly. Thank you in Yiddish.

He nodded, not trusting his voice.

The woman's perfume—violets and age—triggered it: his bar mitzvah. Temple Beth Shalom. Phonetic Hebrew tumbling from his mouth. His grandmother in the front row, crying. Not happy tears.

*"You carry our names forward, Ethan Israel. All of them. The ones who couldn't be here."*

*"It's just a bar mitzvah, Grandma. Everyone has one."*

*"No. Not everyone. You don't know how lucky... Never mind. Dance at your party. Be happy. This is enough."*

But it wasn't enough. He could see that now, standing in the subway, holding the pole where the woman with numbers had held it.

West 4th Street. Bodies shifting. Through the window: gray coat, familiar walk. Not her. Never her. Dead fourteen years ago this September.

Memory: The fight. He was eleven, had brought home a C in Hebrew school. His grandmother's face—not disappointed but furious.

*"You think this is a game? You think Hebrew is just another subject like geography?"*

She'd slammed her palm on the kitchen table. The challah dough jumped.

*"My father would have given anything—ANYTHING—for you to have this chance to learn. And you sit there with your video games, making mockery?"*

His mother had intervened then, keys jangling. *"Mom, he's just a kid."*

*"So were we all. Just kids."*

The anger had drained from her then, leaving something worse—a terrible tiredness.

Spring Street station. He climbed toward daylight. Behind him, conversation fragments:

*"She's sitting shiva for her mother."*

*"What's shiva?"*

*"Jewish thing. Seven days of mourning."*

The 10 AM standup would start without him.

Broome Street. Synagogue doors open. Men hauling out a bench—wood so old it looked soft. The eternal light flickered.

The Torah scrolls passed through the congregation. Age nine, High Holidays. His grandmother pushing him forward.

*"Touch it, bubbeleh. This is yours too."*

He'd pulled back. The rabbi passed. Her hand loosened.

*"It's okay. Maybe next year."*

Next year: bathroom. Year after: stopped going. Year after: dead.

Age eight, Thanksgiving. He'd found her crying in the bathroom—not gentle tears but body-shaking sobs. She held a photograph: three children in sailor suits with yellow stars on their coats.

*"My brothers. My sister."*

*"Where are they?"*

The look she gave him—not sad, not protective. Empty.

*"Gone."*

He'd never seen the photo again. But sometimes caught her looking at him with that same empty expression, as if she was seeing through him to those other children who didn't get to grow up and forget.

Outside a Chase bank on Houston Street. A man holding a cardboard sign: "Jewish. Hungry. Today is still today." Davening slightly, sign swaying.

Hebrew singing from somewhere. He couldn't locate the source. The melody familiar but unplaceable, like hearing your name called in a crowd.

Shanghai, 1941—the candlesticks had been there. She'd told him once, offhand while polishing them. *"These saw more than silver should see."* Now they sat in his closet.

*"These were my mother's. And her mother's. And now..."*

*"Grandma, I don't even light Shabbat candles."*

*"Not now. But someday, maybe. Someone will remember."*

Someone will remember. But no one had. The candlesticks were in his closet, behind shoes he never wore, wrapped in the same yellowed tissue paper.

His phone buzzed. Work. He didn't look.

The last time: Great Neck Assisted Living, September 2009. She'd shrunk, as if something essential had been extracted.

*"It's just Ethan now, Grandma."*

*"You go by Ethan. But where do you go?"*

Two weeks later she was dead. Her yahrzeit candle had burned illegally in her room for twenty-four hours before staff noticed. Small rebellion. Last light.

Delancey Street. Two Orthodox boys arguing about Pokemon cards.

*"Charizard is obviously stronger."*

*"My zeyde says Pokemon is avodah zarah."*

They noticed Ethan watching, went quiet, hurried past.

The wind carried Hebrew melody, and he realized it was coming from his own throat—he was humming it, had been humming for blocks without noticing.

*"Shabbat shalom, Shabbat sha—"*

Lyrics gone. His grandmother had tried to teach him, Friday after Friday, but he'd been more interested in television.

Home. The door stuck. The Thai container had leaked overnight. Through his window: his neighbor's kid practicing violin. Wrong notes. Starting over.

The closet door was stuck. He yanked it open. Behind shoes and jackets he'd forgotten about, the tissue paper from his grandmother's things.

The tissue paper crumbled at his touch—forty years of waiting had made it brittle. The candlesticks inside: tarnished black, one base dented, heavier than he remembered. They smelled of metal and age and his grandmother's apartment—Murphy's oil soap and boiled chicken and something else she'd never been able to scrub away.

He set them on the kitchen counter next to his coffee maker. One wobbled—the dented base. In the overhead light, scratches in the silver looked almost like Hebrew letters. Almost.

No candles. He checked the junk drawer anyway—birthday candles from years ago, a lavender aromatherapy candle from an ex. Nothing that belonged.

Outside, Brooklyn's Friday night was beginning. Through the walls, that Hebrew melody again, clearer now. A child's voice joining in, learning the words.

From somewhere below: a child's voice. *"Mommy, why do we light candles?"*

Muffled response: *"Because Bubbe did."*

*"But why did Bubbe?"*

Silence. Or an answer too quiet to hear.

Ethan stood in his kitchen, holding his grandmother's candlesticks. Empty, waiting. He opened the drawer, found matches left from winter blackouts. Struck one. The flame caught, steady and warm.

He held it over the candlestick, watching wax begin to pool in the base from some long-ago candle.

Then blew it out.

The smell of sulfur faded. The candlesticks remained.
