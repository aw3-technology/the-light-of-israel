# Chapter 31: Vision on the Mount

The Temple Mount at dawn, empty except for birds, and I saw what was, what is, and what might be—all three tenses collapsing into a single moment that contained every prayer ever whispered here, every stone laid and destroyed and laid again.

He hadn't planned to be there. Jews rarely received permission to ascend, and when they did, it came with restrictions. But around 6 AM on the last day of Sukkot, walking the Old City walls in the half-light, something pulled him toward the Mughrabi Gate. The morning air tasted of sage and dust, ancient spices carried on wind that shouldn't exist between stone walls. His footsteps echoed wrong—too loud, then too soft, as if the sound were being filtered through time.

The guard looked up from his phone. Ahmad al-Rashid, according to his name tag, mid-forties, wedding ring worn thin from years of nervous twisting. Dark circles under his eyes, purple-black like bruises. The booth smelled of Turkish coffee gone cold, cigarette smoke clinging to fabric. He'd been here all night—Ethan could smell the exhaustion on him, sour and human.

"You don't have permission," Ahmad said in accented English, but without conviction. His shoulders sagged with something heavier than fatigue.

"No."

They stood there. Ahmad glanced at the security camera, back at Ethan, rubbed his face with both hands. "My daughter. She's sick. Leukemia. The doctors at Hadassah..." He stopped. "Yesterday she said she dreamed of a man with light. American. Said he would come to the morning gate."

Ethan felt something shift in his chest—fear or recognition.

"Seven years old. She shouldn't—" Ahmad shook his head. "Kids that age, they say crazy things. But she described your face." He looked around—they were alone, but never really alone here. "Morning shift arrives in twelve minutes."

Ahmad stared at the security pad, numbers worn smooth by years of entry. His hands shook. "If they check the logs... I have six years until retirement. Pension for my daughter's treatments." His jaw worked. "Why should I risk that for you?"

Ethan had no answer.

Ahmad laughed bitterly. "My grandfather called prayer here forty years. Now my son won't visit from Berlin. Says he's ashamed of us all—the occupation, the collaboration, the whole mess." He looked up at the security camera. "Maybe he's right. Maybe we're all just keeping other people's peace."

His finger hovered over the keypad. "You have children?"

"Twin boys."

"Then you know." Ahmad's voice turned hard. "We do stupid things for them. And stupid things to keep them safe." He punched in the code. "Coffee spill on the keypad. Happens all the time."

The lock clicked.

"Quickly."

Ethan climbed the wooden ramp, each plank creaking a different note, a melody he almost recognized. His legs felt unsteady, as if the ground were tilting. At the top, the plaza opened—limestone worn smooth by millions of feet, each stone humming at a frequency just below hearing. Jerusalem sage sharp in the October air, but underneath it something else—frankincense, myrrh, the ghost of temple incense that shouldn't still linger after two thousand years. A cat watched from beneath an olive tree, its eyes reflecting light that wasn't there yet, tail twitching at things Ethan was beginning to see at the edges of his vision.

The Dome of the Rock caught first light, gold burning against blue sky—but the gold moved, rippled, breathed. The blue tiles sang, each one a different note in a harmony that made Ethan's teeth ache. Al-Aqsa stretched elegant to the south, its arches whispering Arabic that he suddenly understood without knowing how. Between them, the vast plaza where everything had happened and was still happening—he could see it all at once, layered like transparent photographs: Solomon's temple, Herod's courts, Crusader churches, Ottoman fountains, all existing simultaneously.

Birds erupted—dozens of doves, their wings making sounds like Hebrew letters being spoken. Each feather left silver-white script in the air that hung for a moment before dissolving.

Ethan's vision sharpened until everything became too clear. The stones beneath his feet pulsed with their own heartbeat, and he could feel it through his shoes, up his legs, synchronizing with his own pulse until he couldn't tell where he ended and the Mount began.

Then fire.

Not metaphor—actual heat on his face, cedar smoke thick in his throat. The sound of stones falling carried the salt taste of tears, grief as physical weight in his chest. He was watching it burn, but also burning with it—Rome taking what couldn't be taken, only transformed.

Terror flooded him. *What is this? Am I dying? Having a stroke?* Unlike Warsaw's gentle revelations or Egypt's patient teaching, this place demanded everything at once. It wasn't offering healing—it was breaking him open, spilling him out. His grandmother's voice: "Sometimes God speaks in ways that hurt." But this wasn't hurt. This was dissolution.

The Dome blazed golden, and the gold rang like bells. Blood from his nose mixed copper with cedar ash. Men arriving for Fajr moved in ripples he could see, concentric circles of faith spreading outward, passing through him.

Children played where the Temple courtyards had been—Arab and Jewish children together, their voices harmonizing. Then walls rose between them, each brick a small death in his chest. Then the walls crumbled, the reunion sharp with joy and salt.

He saw himself falling through layers of time, each century a different weight pressing down. Not metaphor but physics—gravity pulling him through Solomon's gold, Herod's marble, crusader stone, all the way down to bedrock that hummed with accumulated prayer.

*This is madness,* some part of him thought. *Or holiness. Probably both.*

When his sight cleared—like coming up from deep water, lungs burning—he was sitting on stones that felt too solid after what he'd experienced. Ahmad pressing water to his lips, the liquid shocking cold, tasting of ordinary minerals, blessedly normal. "You fell. Hit your head." Ahmad's voice sounded flat after the symphonies he'd been hearing, but the accent made each word feel carefully chosen, precious.

"Did you see—"

"I saw you fall." Ahmad's face was careful, neutral. Then, quieter: "My grandfather had visions here. Before the medications. Said this place..." He gestured helplessly. "Shows you things."

"What did you see?"

Ahmad was quiet for a moment, eyes on the golden Dome. "A man who needed water. A father thinking of his sick daughter." He paused, almost smiled. "Birds flying in circles. Could mean anything. Or nothing."

Ahmad pulled out a worn photo from his wallet: his grandfather and another man in 1940s Haifa, arms around each other's shoulders, both smiling. "They owned shops next to each other. Made some kind of promise about..." He trailed off, studying Ethan's face. "Probably nothing."

He put the photo away. "My grandfather had strange ideas about time. Said some debts take generations to pay."

They traded numbers without talking about why.

Ethan walked back as Jerusalem woke—shops opening, children heading to school, the ordinary miracle of a city that had died and revived more times than anyone could count. His head throbbed. The vision felt distant now, like trying to remember a dream.

At home, Sera was feeding the twins. Ari fussing, Lev patient. She looked up, saw his face.

"Where were you?" 

"Walking. The Old City." 

"You look awful." Her voice sharpened. "What happened? Ethan, you're scaring me."

"I think... I don't know what happened." He sat heavily. "I was on the Temple Mount somehow and I had some kind of—vision? Seizure? I don't know."

"The Temple Mount?" She set down Avi's bottle hard. "How did you—" She stopped, stared at him. "You're bleeding."

He touched his nose. Dried blood.

"Jesus, Ethan. What if something had happened? What if you'd had a real seizure up there? What if they'd arrested you?" Her voice rose. "I'm here with two babies and you're off having mystical experiences in the most contested piece of real estate on earth?"

"Sera—"

"No." She stood, Avi still in her arms. "You get to search for meaning. You get to fall apart and rebuild yourself. But I don't get to fall apart, do I? I just get to hold everything together while you figure out who you are." Her eyes were bright with tears she wouldn't let fall. "I need you present. Not transcendent. Present."

She handed him Ezra, who immediately spit up on his shirt. "You're burning up. Eat something. Be a father."

But something had shifted. Or nothing had. He'd either touched the divine or had a minor medical episode. The Mount kept its secrets.

That evening, Ahmad texted: "Daughter's fever broke. Doctors say good sign."

Then: "What you saw this morning. My grandfather used to say this place shows people what they need to see. Good and bad together."

Then: "Better delete these."

Ethan deleted them, but the words remained. Like the vision—maybe neurons misfiring in a charged place. Maybe something else. Maybe it didn't matter which.

He thought of Samira's students and the girl at the checkpoint; Ahmad's daughter belonged beside his own boys now, not as a counterpoint but as part of what he held when he said this city out loud.

He put the boys to bed, started the Shema, then stopped. The words felt suddenly foreign in his mouth, too big, too certain.

"Shema..." he began again, then just hummed the melody.

Avi looked at him with dark, serious eyes. Ezra had already fallen asleep.

Outside, sunset over Jerusalem, every stone looking like it held fire from within.

Somewhere on the Temple Mount, Ahmad was finishing his shift, thinking about his daughter, his son who wouldn't visit, the American who'd fallen or floated or something between.

Ethan touched where his head had hit stone. The bump was real. The vision felt real too, though he couldn't say how.

His phone buzzed. Ahmad: "Deleted everything. But kept the photo."

Then the twins stirred, both at once, their small fists clenching like they were grasping something invisible. Or letting it go.
