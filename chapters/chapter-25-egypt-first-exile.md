# Chapter 25: Egypt — First Exile

The Nile flowed as ever; Ethan Israel Stone had not.

Thursday morning, December 7th. Ethan stood on his Cairo hotel balcony watching the sun rise over the Nile. Below, car horns and call to prayer, the smell of diesel and breakfast rising with the heat.

Forty days since he'd left Israel. Poland's earth still in his pocket. Roman recipes in his journal. German questions in his bones. And now Egypt, the first exile, the archetypal narrow place from which every Jewish story began with leaving.

His phone showed seventeen missed calls from his mother. "Egypt? Ethan, why Egypt? It's not safe for Jews."

But that was exactly why he'd come. To complete the circuit. To stand in the original narrow place and understand how leaving had become the central Jewish story.

The taxi driver studied him in the rearview mirror. "American?"

"Yes."

"Business or tourist?"

"Visiting history."

The driver—Mohamed, according to his license—laughed. "All tourists visit history. You want pyramids? Sphinx?"

"Actually," Ethan said, showing his phone, "I need to go here."

Mohamed looked at the address, his expression shifting. The Jewish Quarter. "Why you want go there? Nothing there for tourists."

"There's a synagogue."

Silence filled the car. Mohamed's eyes found his again. "You are Jewish?"

The question hung between them. In Poland, asked with curiosity. In Rome, indifference. In Germany, careful politeness. Here, different weight—four thousand years of weight.

"Yes."

Mohamed drove in silence, navigating Cairo's impossible traffic. Finally: "You know what we think about Israel here."

"I know."

"But individual Jews... People of the Book. Protected. Guests."

The synagogue looked like nothing. Deliberately nothing. Hidden behind walls and guards.

Inside, nine old men sat in what had once been grand. Nine. One short of a minyan.

When Ethan entered, they looked up with desperate hope. The eldest, Joseph Haroun, stood with difficulty. Another man—thin, wearing a yarmulke held down with bobby pins—muttered, "Finally. My grandson's wedding photos are getting cold in my pocket."

"Hush, Sami," Joseph said. "You are the tenth," he told Ethan. "We have been here since dawn hoping for a tenth."

"Since dawn?" Sami adjusted his bobby pins. "I've been here since Thursday. My arthritis doesn't care about your dramatic timing."

They needed no explanation. He was Jewish, he was the tenth, he was the answer to their morning prayer that they might pray.

The service proceeded in Hebrew that sounded different here—Egyptian-accented, ancient, like the language remembered being spoken by slaves, by princes, by Moses.

After prayers, Joseph insisted on tea. "Real tea," he said, "not the tourist garbage. My late wife Miriam knew how to make proper tea." He measured leaves with the precision of a pharmacist. "She ran the kosher kitchen at Adly Mansour Hospital for thirty years. Fed half the Jewish community when they were sick, and half the Muslim doctors too."

Sami adjusted his bobby pins. "Joseph's always talking about his wife. Dead ten years, still arguing with her."

"Twelve years," Joseph corrected sharply. "And she never let me win an argument alive, why should death change that?"

David showed Ethan a creased photo. "My great-granddaughter in Montreal. Twelve years old, speaks perfect French, decent Hebrew, not a word of Arabic." His pride mixed with loss. "Her mother sends videos sometimes. The girl's winning math competitions."

"You see this cabinet?" Joseph fumbled with keys. "Not the famous Geniza—Cambridge University owns our history now, making British careers out of our letters." His bitterness was earned. "But we kept some fragments they missed."

He opened it carefully. "Business correspondence mostly. This one—1967, right after the war. A coffee merchant writing to his partner in Milan: 'Nasser's speeches getting uglier. Time to liquidate inventory.'" His finger traced faded Arabic mixed with Hebrew. "My father's handwriting. He was that merchant."

"How many Jews are left in all of Egypt?"

The three men exchanged glances. Joseph sighed. "Official count? Maybe fifty. Real count?" He shrugged. "Who knows? Some hide it completely. Can you blame them?"

The cemetery: vandalized tombstones, broken stones. Someone had tried to clean up—probably Joseph's group.

In Khan el-Khalili bazaar, Ethan stopped at a bookstall. "Protocols" in Arabic beside cookbooks. "Mein Kampf" next to travel guides. The vendor, seeing his interest, said in English: "Very popular. Explains many things." He tapped the cover. "History books."

Ethan walked away without comment.

Back in the taxi, Mohamed had been quiet, navigating traffic with the focused aggression of a Cairo native. Finally: "So you are really Jewish? American Jewish or...?"

"American. But my family comes from Poland originally."

Mohamed nodded, working through something. "My daughter, she studies at university. International relations. She says the situation is..." He searched for words. "Complicated."

"Your daughter sounds smart."

"Too smart. Questions everything I tell her about Israel, about Jews." A rueful laugh. "Kids today, they read too much internet."

"What about Jews who used to live here? In Egypt?"

Mohamed's grip shifted on the wheel. "That's ancient history. My grandmother, she had Jewish neighbors in Heliopolis. Before I was born." He paused. "She used to say they made the best pastries in the neighborhood. But after 1967..."

"After 1967?"

"Politics changed everything. Nasser on the radio every day. 'The Jews, the Jews.' People got scared, angry." His voice dropped. "My grandmother, she was sad about it. 'Good people,' she used to say. 'Where did they go?'"

At a traffic light, Mohamed turned to study him. "You don't look like what I expected."

"What did you expect?"

"I don't know. Different somehow."


His phone showed sunset approaching. First night of Hanukkah—he'd almost forgotten.

"There's somewhere else I need to go," he told Mohamed. "By the water."

Mohamed looked skeptical. "Red Sea? You want expensive tourist beach?"

"Not tourist. Just water."

At the shore, wind whipped off the sea. A few late swimmers, some fishermen mending nets. Ethan pulled out his grandmother's small travel candlesticks, the ones she'd carried from Poland to Brooklyn.

*This is strange,* he thought, setting them on a rock. *But then again, so was everything about this journey.*

Mohamed approached, curious despite himself. "What are you doing?"

"Lighting candles. Holiday called Hanukkah."

"Like Christmas?"

"Older. About fighting back. About light surviving when it shouldn't."

Ethan struck a match. The first candle caught, flame dancing in the salt wind. He said the blessing quietly, more for himself than performance.

Mohamed watched, hands in his pockets. "My grandmother used to light candles too. Islamic way, but..." He shrugged. "Light is light."

They stood together as the candle burned down, wind threatening to extinguish it but failing. When it was finished, Ethan walked to the water's edge and pulled out the vial of Polish earth.

*Melodramatic,* he thought. *But somehow necessary.*

He scattered the soil into the foam. Not ritual, not theater—just completion. The earth that had been witness to the worst mixing with water that had witnessed the first leaving.

"I'm going back to Israel," he told Mohamed.

"Of course you are," Mohamed replied, without judgment. "Everyone leaves Egypt eventually."

Next morning, Joseph unwrapped a fragment in protective plastic. "Geniza piece. A merchant writing to his son in Jerusalem, 1099."

Ancient Hebrew, faded: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem..."

"Even then," Joseph said. "Even a thousand years ago, we were leaving." He rewrapped it carefully. "My hands shake now. Soon I won't be able to handle these properly."

At the airport, security was thorough. The officer examined his passport, noting the stamps.

"Purpose of visit to Egypt?"

"Tourism. Historical sites."

The man nodded, stamped the exit visa. Standard procedure, nothing more.

The Cyprus-Tel Aviv flight was routine until the Hebrew announcements began. Something unexpected tightened in Ethan's chest—not homesickness exactly, but recognition.

*Forty days away and the language sounds like news from another planet,* he thought.

The woman beside him glanced over as he wiped his eyes. "Long trip?" she asked in accented English.

"Very long."

"Israel?" 

"Among other places."

She nodded knowingly. "The wandering gets old."

Through the window, pyramids faded to memory. Egypt receding, becoming story again—the place Jews carried in their collective memory as the first departure, the original leaving that made all other leavings possible.

The plane touched down. Passengers applauded—Israelis grateful for another safe landing in the only country that would always take them. Through the window, the Judean hills. Jerusalem somewhere beyond them.

Customs. The officer looked at his passport—Warsaw, Rome, Berlin, Cairo.

"Tourism?"

"Something like that."

She stamped it. "Bruchim haba'im." Welcome.

"Todah." The word came without thought.

Outside, December light. Hebrew voices. The smell of diesel and possibility.

*Home.* The word sat differently now, less urgent, more tentative. Not the destination of a pilgrimage but a place to pause, to sort through what he'd collected.

He walked toward the arrivals hall, carrying forty days of questions. Poland's grief, Rome's continuity, Germany's reckonings, Egypt's stubborn survival—all of it settling into something that might, eventually, become understanding.

But not yet. Not tonight.
