# Chapter 6: The Night Before

The candlesticks on his counter seemed to glow in the darkness, though he hadn't lit them.

Friday night, October 6th. Netflix asked if he was still watching serial killers or startup founders—the plots had blurred into stories about people destroying everything except what needed destroying: the emptiness. His phone: 7:18 PM. Three missed calls from his mother. One text from Aaron: "Still on for coffee tomorrow?"

Tomorrow. Saturday. October 7th. Something about the date scratched inside his skull.

Thai food sat untouched, smelling wrong—too synthetic. His stomach turned with that feeling before flights, before news that changes everything. Except he had no flights, no news coming.

The candlesticks caught his eye. His grandmother's brass holders, discovered that afternoon in the closet. Unlit. Friday night at 8:41 PM.

Browser tabs multiplied: "Brooklyn therapists accepting insurance." "Normal to feel empty at 33." "Hebrew letter meanings" (clicked by accident, closed, reopened). "Tensions escalate along Gaza border." "Time in Israel."

Work emails pulsed. Mom texted about a British mystery show he'd never recommended. He replied "Love you too" at 9:47 PM.

The exhaustion hit suddenly—soul exhaustion, the kind sleep couldn't cure. He collapsed onto unmade sheets. The candlesticks pulsed in his peripheral vision, or maybe that was just tired eyes seeing patterns in nothing.

Sleep came wrong—too fast, falling past dream into something older.

The garden was made of names.

Each tree a genealogy growing backwards into earth that smelled like his grandmother's kitchen. He stood in the center where his own name grew. Not Ethan, not Stone, but the hidden one that meant wrestling.

"Israel," the garden said.

The trees began burning. Not consumed but burning, flame revealing what was already there—every leaf a letter, every branch a word in stories older than telling.

"Ethan Israel Stone."

His grandmother's voice, but young, thirty-three like him, standing in a dress he'd never seen but recognized.

"You're not her," he said, knowing it was a dream but unsure what real meant anymore.

"I'm exactly her. Tomorrow everything changes. For all of us. For Israel."

"I'm not Israel. I'm Ethan."

"You're the wrestling that makes the name true."

The garden shifted, became wall—infinite wall reaching past sky. His hand found warm limestone, pulse beneath rock. From every crack between stones, papers fell like snow, prayers pressed into stone by hands like his.

He pressed both palms against the wall, felt it pulse back. Not just receiving the vision but choosing to stay in it, choosing to touch what called to him.

"I don't know the prayers," he said.

"You are the prayer," came her voice—not mystical oracle but his grandmother's practical certainty, the tone she'd used when teaching him to count change or tie shoes. Matter-of-fact magic.

"Tomorrow the world breaks. But breaking isn't ending, bubbeleh. It's how we let the light in. Like when you crack an egg—looks like destruction, but it's breakfast."

Her metaphors always domestic, always immediate. Even prophecy served with kitchen wisdom.

"What light?"

"The hidden light. Or HaGanuz. From before there was a sun. Before there was anything to light up except the possibility of everything."

"I don't understand."

"You will. After tomorrow. After you remember your name isn't hiding from anything. It's wrestling with everything."

The dream shattered—or did it end? Each piece becoming fragments he couldn't quite grasp, like trying to hold water.

3:33 AM.

He woke to sheets twisted into shapes that might have been Hebrew letters. The apartment felt different—darker than dark should be. Were the streetlights out? Or had something else changed?

The candlesticks in the kitchen—glowing or just reflecting something? Brass conducting energy or just catching light from sources he couldn't identify.

He stumbled to the bathroom, looked in the mirror. His face seemed different. Not changed but revealed. Or was that just 3:33 AM face, the way everyone looked in fluorescent light after strange dreams?

Back to bed. Sleep came floating now, lucid but distant. In the space between dreams, his grandmother sat at a Sabbath table. Waiting.

"Soon," she said. Or he imagined she said. Or needed her to say.

---

5:41 AM.

Dawn preparing but not yet broken. Birds gathering song. His phone: completely dead. He plugged it in, watched the apple appear, disappear, the daily resurrection of connectivity.

Shower. Coffee. Saturday morning rituals though it was too early for Saturday, too late for Friday.

The candlesticks just brass again. Inheritance on a counter. Had they been glowing? Or had that been streetlight, dream-logic, the way tiredness made everything seem significant?

His phone finishing resurrection. Notifications loading. Screen becoming—

6:47 AM.

In five seconds, the world would break.
In four seconds, history would pivot.
In three seconds, everything would become before and after.
In two seconds—
In one—

The birds stopped singing.
Brooklyn held its breath.
October 7th.

His phone began to buzz.

Not one notification but dozens, hundreds. Breaking news becoming broken world. The buzz becoming roar becoming the sound everything makes when it discovers distance is illusion, safety temporary.

But for this moment—this last moment before the world divided—Ethan Stone sat on his bed in Brooklyn, candlesticks waiting in the kitchen.

Had his grandmother's dream been prophecy or warning? Had the candlesticks glowed or just reflected his need to see light in the darkness coming?

Israel.
The wrestling was about to begin.

His phone buzzed again.
And again.
And again.
