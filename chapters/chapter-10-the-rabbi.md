# Chapter 10: The Rabbi

The building at 541 West 77th Street looked like any other brownstone on the Upper West Side—expensive, historic, slightly weathered by decades of New York winters that carved character into brick and mortar. Tuesday evening, mid-October, the air carrying that particular Manhattan autumn quality of exhaust and dying leaves and something indefinable that made everything feel like the last scene of something or the first scene of something else.

Ethan had walked past three times before stopping.

First pass: 5:47 PM, telling himself he was just walking, just thinking, just needing movement after another day of optimization meetings where he'd spoken in fluent corporate while his mind replayed Friday's Shabbat service like a song he couldn't stop humming.

Second pass: 5:56 PM, checking the address against the card the greeter had pressed into his hand—Rabbi Levi Ben-David, Tuesday Evening Learning, All Levels Welcome, No Experience Necessary. The last line underlined by hand in blue ink, as if she'd known he'd need that specific reassurance.

Third pass: 6:09 PM, and now he stood at the base of thirty-six steps worn smooth by generations of feet seeking what he wasn't sure he was seeking, each step numbered in his mind though no numbers were visible, the counting automatic like breath, like heartbeat, like the Hebrew letters that had been appearing in his dreams since the vigil—aleph, bet, gimel—the alphabet of creation starting over in his unconscious.

The mezuzah on the doorframe caught the dying light, brass or bronze, he couldn't tell, inscribed with the Hebrew letter shin that looked like a three-fingered hand reaching or blessing or warning. He knew he was supposed to touch it, kiss his fingers, but his hand stayed in his pocket, clenched around his phone that showed three missed calls from his mother and a text from Aaron: "Drinks tonight? That new place on Rivington?"

The door opened before he knocked.

"I thought that was you." The secretary, a woman in her sixties with silver hair pinned practical and eyes that sparkled with some private amusement, stepped aside to let him in. "Third time's the charm, they say. Though in Hebrew, three times makes a pattern, a chazakah, a presumption of permanence."

"I wasn't—I was just—"

"Walking? Yes. Rabbi Levi mentioned you might be walking by tonight. He has a gift for knowing when someone's circling." She glanced at her watch, an old-fashioned analog that showed exactly 6:13. "He's finishing with another student. But he said if you came, you should wait. Tea?"

The waiting room was everything his startup's office wasn't—worn wooden floors that creaked with history, walls lined with photographs of rabbis and scholars dating back decades, maybe centuries, their eyes following him with the particular patience of people who measured time differently than quarterly earnings reports. A radiator clanked somewhere, the building's heartbeat irregular but continuous.

"Sugar?" The secretary had returned with a glass of tea in a metal holder, the Russian style, steam rising like the prayers he still didn't know how to say.

"No, thank you."

"There are thirty-six cubes if you change your mind. Lamed-vav. The number of hidden righteous ones who sustain the world." She set a bowl beside him, the sugar cubes perfectly aligned like tiny white bricks of potential sweetness. "Though between you and me, the world could use a few more than thirty-six these days."

A door down the hallway opened, releasing a young woman who looked like she'd been crying, though her face showed relief more than sorrow. She nodded at the secretary, glanced at Ethan with the solidarity of someone recognizing another traveler on the same difficult journey, then left, her footsteps light on the stairs as if she'd set down something heavy.

"You can go in now," the secretary said, though Ethan hadn't heard any summons, any bell, any indication that the rabbi was ready. "Last door on the right. Don't worry about knocking. Doors that matter open when they're meant to."

The hallway stretched longer than the building should have contained, that New York magic of interiors defying external geometry. Portraits of past rabbis watched from the walls, men with beards like winter storms and eyes that suggested they'd seen both the worst and best of what humans could do and had chosen to keep teaching anyway.

The study door was slightly open, warm light spilling out like an invitation or a test. Ethan stood for exactly eighteen seconds—he counted, couldn't help counting, the numbers had become a kind of comfort since the vigil—before pushing it wider.

"Shalom, Ethan Israel Stone."

The words hit him like cold water, like recognition, like coming home to find someone had been keeping the lights on in your absence. Rabbi Levi Ben-David stood from behind a desk that looked older than America, his hand extended, his face showing no surprise at Ethan's shocked expression.

"How did you—my middle name. I never—nobody knows that name."

"Your grandmother Rivka knew it. Spoke it six hundred and thirteen times by my count, though she probably said it more when I wasn't listening." The rabbi was younger than Ethan expected, maybe fifty, his beard still more pepper than salt, his eyes the kind of brown that looked like they contained libraries. "She was my teacher's student in Brooklyn. Before the Parkinson's. Before the forgetting. When she still remembered everything and everyone, especially the grandson with the biblical name who was going to change the world someday."

The room spun slightly, or maybe Ethan spun while the room stayed still. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves rose like walls of compressed wisdom, Hebrew and English and what looked like Aramaic, German, Arabic—seventy languages at least, the tongues of exile and return bound in leather and cloth and possibility. The rabbi gestured to a chair that looked comfortable enough to fall asleep in or uncomfortable enough to keep you awake for important conversations.

"She talked about me? To you?"

"To everyone who would listen and several who wouldn't. 'My Ethan,' she'd say. Always 'my Ethan,' like you were a secret she was keeping for the right moment. She worried about you. Said you had a Jewish soul in exile from itself."

A book fell from a shelf—actually fell, though there'd been no earthquake, no vibration, nothing to dislodge it. It landed open on the floor between them, page 124 visible, Hebrew text Ethan couldn't read but that seemed to pulse with meaning anyway. As he leaned to look closer, the overhead light flickered three times, then steadied.

"The Zohar," Rabbi Levi said, not moving to pick it up. "Printed in Mantua, 1558. Very opinionated about timing." He squinted at the page. "That section's about names—how they carry essence. Your name, Ethan, adds up to 124 in gematria. Make of that what you will."

"That's not—books don't—"

"Fall at convenient times? No, usually they don't. But this room has its own weather. Sir, sit. You're making me nervous standing there like you might bolt. Though if you need to bolt, the door remains open. It always remains open."

Ethan sat. The chair embraced him like it had been waiting, shaped by decades of other seekers who'd come with their own questions, their own middle names they'd hidden, their own grandmothers they'd disappointed by forgetting.

The rabbi poured tea from a samovar that hadn't been there a moment ago, or had always been there but Ethan hadn't noticed, the steam forming shapes that looked almost like letters before dissolving. The clock on the wall showed 7:18, which couldn't be right because it hadn't been an hour since he'd arrived, but time seemed to follow different rules in this room full of books that fell when they wanted to make a point.

"So," Rabbi Levi said, settling into his own chair with the careful movements of someone nursing an old back injury. "What brought you here tonight?"

"I don't know. The woman at services gave me your card."

"No, what brought your soul here? Your neshamah has been—" He paused, wincing slightly as he adjusted his position. "Sorry, old wrestling injury. From actual wrestling, not the metaphorical kind. Your soul has been calling for weeks."

"I'm not religious."

"Neither was Moses when the bush caught fire." The rabbi fumbled with his glasses, cleaning them on his shirt. "The point is, what's calling you?"

"October 7th."

"No."

"No?"

"October 7th woke something, yes. But it didn't create anything. You can't wake something that isn't already there, sleeping maybe, dormant possibly, but there. What was already there, Ethan Israel Stone?"

The radiator clanked seven times, though Ethan hadn't heard it before. The books seemed to lean in, listening. Somewhere in the building a door opened and closed, footsteps ascending or descending, the sound of other people seeking other answers to other questions that might all be the same question asked in different languages.

"I don't know who I am."

The words came out cracked, broken, like shells around something that had been waiting to hatch. The rabbi nodded as if this was the right answer, the only answer, the answer he'd been expecting since Ethan started circling the building like a planet around a sun he didn't want to admit existed.

"Good. That's good. Most people think they know who they are, which prevents them from becoming who they're supposed to be. Not knowing is the beginning of wisdom. Socrates said that, though he probably stole it from the Jews. We're very quotable when we're not being difficult."

Rabbi Levi pulled a volume from the shelf—the Sefer Yetzirah, Book of Creation, the binding held together with tape. His fingers traced the cracked spine tenderly.

"The hidden light, ohr haganuz." He opened to a page marked with a grocery receipt. "Your depression—and yes, I can see it—" He stopped himself. "Keep taking medication if you're on it. I'm not a doctor. But sometimes depression is the soul in exile from itself."

"How do you—"

"Know that look? Practice." He rubbed his temple. "Half my congregants are on something. Including me, if we're being honest. Sertraline. Ten years now. Sometimes chemistry helps. But sometimes what feels like depression is grief for a self we've never met."

The book on the floor had closed itself, or the draft had closed it, or Ethan was losing his mind in this room where physics seemed negotiable. The rabbi noticed his glance and smiled.

"You're not losing your mind. You're finding it. Different process, similar discomfort. Here."

He handed Ethan a piece of paper, photocopied from something older, Hebrew on one side, English on the other. Psalm 137. By the rivers of Babylon.

"Read this. Not tonight—tonight you need to go home and pretend this was all normal, regular, explicable. Read it Thursday. Don't try to understand it, just let it speak. Language is technology, Ethan. Hebrew especially. The letters aren't just symbols, they're... programs. Codes. They run in the background once you install them, reorganizing things, defragging the hard drive of consciousness."

"You're comparing Torah to software?"

"Why not? Both are systems for processing reality. Both can—" His phone buzzed. He glanced at it, frowned. "Sorry, my daughter. She's having a crisis about her bat mitzvah Torah portion. Sixteen texts about whether Leviticus is relevant to climate change." He silenced the phone. "Where were we?"

Ethan folded the paper once, twice, small enough to fit in his wallet. The rabbi watched him, then glanced at the clock and suppressed a sigh. Through the door, Ethan could hear footsteps—another student waiting.

"Come back Thursday. After you've read it. We'll study properly then." The rabbi stood, his back clearly bothering him. "Your grandmother was right to name you Israel. Means 'wrestles with God.'"

"I don't believe in God."

"That's fine. God believes in you." He paused at his own words, looking slightly embarrassed. "Sorry, that sounded less cliché in my head. What I mean is—" Another knock at the door. "Thursday. We'll talk Thursday."

The clock showed 7:41, which meant twenty-three minutes had passed, though it felt like hours, like years, like no time at all. The rabbi stood, the signal clear that this first meeting was ending, though something else was beginning, had already begun, had maybe been in motion since Ethan's grandmother whispered his three names over his newborn head thirty-three years ago.

"Wait," Ethan said at the door. "You said my grandmother spoke my name six hundred and thirteen times. That's very specific."

"It's the number of mitzvot. Commandments. Though commandment is a terrible translation. Mitzvot are more like... connections. Points of contact between the finite and infinite. Your grandmother did them all, in her way, through speaking your name. Made you holy through repetition. Sanctified you through sound. It's very Jewish, turning anxiety into prayer. We're professionals at it."

The hallway seemed shorter walking out. The secretary was gone, her desk lamp still on, tea glass empty except for sugar cube residue. A Talmud lay open beside it—Tractate Berakhot, the section on evening prayers, marginalia in three different hands spanning decades.

Outside, the October night had turned properly cold, autumn asserting itself against the lingering warmth of climate change. The thirty-six steps down felt different—not like descent but like integration, each step incorporating something, accepting something, allowing something that had been kept out to come in.

His phone showed 8:17, which couldn't be right because he'd entered at 6:13 and been inside for... how long? He checked his phone again. Still 8:17. Then 8:18. Time resuming its normal flow, or pretending to.

The N train came immediately, as if summoned. The car was nearly empty, just him and an elderly Black woman reading a Hebrew Bible—the Koren edition with Rashi commentary, her finger tracking right to left, her lips moving silently.

She looked up as he sat down, studied his face with the fearlessness of age, then smiled.

"You've been to see the rabbi."

"How did you—"

"You have that look. Scrambled but settling. Like an egg that's been whisked but is starting to cook into something. He's good, Rabbi Levi. Sees through the surface. Saw through mine forty years ago when I was converting, when everyone said a Black woman had no business with Torah. He said Torah had business with me, which was different, which was everything."

The train pulled into 14th Street. She stood to exit, then turned back.

"That paper in your pocket. Psalm 137. By the rivers of Babylon. It was my first assignment too. Forty years ago. Still makes me cry when I read it. The good kind of crying, though. The kind that waters things so they can grow."

The doors closed before Ethan could respond. The train continued south, under the city, through the darkness that connected everything to everything else. He pulled out the paper, unfolded it, saw the Hebrew letters he couldn't read yet but that seemed to pulse with meaning anyway, patient as seeds, waiting for the right conditions to germinate.

At Canal Street, he transferred to the Q, muscle memory navigating while his mind stayed in that study, in that moment when his middle name had been spoken aloud for the first time in twenty years, the sound of it like a key turning in a lock he'd forgotten existed.

His apartment building doorman didn't comment on his expression, though something must have shown because Carlos just nodded and said, "Good evening, Mr. Stone. Peace be with you tonight."

"And also with you," Ethan responded automatically, then wondered where that came from, what liturgy was leaking into his everyday speech, what prayers were teaching themselves to him without his permission.

Inside his apartment, everything looked the same but felt different, like when you return from vacation and your space seems foreign, needing to be reclaimed or released. The grandmother's candlesticks still sat on the dining table where he'd placed them after Friday's service, tarnished silver waiting to hold light.

He set the psalm on the table beside them, the Hebrew side up, the letters mysterious but insistent, like a message in a bottle written in a language he'd once known but had forgotten, though forgetting and never learning looked the same from the outside, felt the same from the inside, until suddenly they didn't, until suddenly the forgetting revealed itself as just another form of remembering, waiting its turn, biding its time, patient as Hebrew letters on a page, patient as a rabbi in a study, patient as God if God existed, which Ethan still didn't believe but was starting to consider considering.

His phone buzzed. Aaron: "Dude, where are you? This place has $5 well drinks until 9."

Ethan typed: "Can't make it. Something came up."

"What could possibly come up on a Tuesday night?"

He looked at the psalm, the candlesticks, his reflection in the dark window that showed a man who looked exactly like him but different, older maybe, or younger, or just more himself than he'd been three hours ago when he'd stood at the bottom of those thirty-six steps, counting without knowing why counting mattered.

"I'm studying," he typed, then deleted it. "I'm remembering something," he typed, then deleted that too. Finally: "I'll explain later."

But he wouldn't explain, couldn't explain, because some things required language he didn't have yet, Hebrew he couldn't read yet, names he'd hidden for so long that speaking them aloud felt like either betrayal or redemption, and he wasn't sure which, wouldn't be sure for weeks yet, maybe months, maybe never, and maybe that uncertainty was the point, was the wrestle, was what Israel meant when it meant anything at all.

He opened his laptop, then closed it. Opened his work email, then closed that too. Everything that had seemed urgent this morning felt distant now, like news from another country written in another alphabet that he was slowly, letter by letter, beginning to forget how to read as he remembered how to read something else, something older, something that had been waiting in his name all along.

Thursday, the rabbi had said. Come back Thursday.

Ethan looked at his calendar, the Thursday slot marked with three meetings about user engagement optimization. He opened the calendar, selected all three meetings, and clicked decline.

The candles in their tarnished holders caught the overhead light and threw it back changed, transformed, made holy by reflection if holy was a word that meant anything, which it didn't, which it did, which it might, Thursday, after the psalm, after the rivers, after the remembering that felt like forgetting everything he'd thought he'd known.

Outside, New York continued its Tuesday night communion of sirens and car horns and people living lives that intersected and diverged according to patterns no one could map but everyone could feel, the city itself a kind of prayer, a gathering, a minyan of millions saying without saying that being alone together was different from being alone alone, was its own form of worship if worship meant anything, which it didn't, which it did, which it would, Thursday, when he returned to that study where books fell when they needed to fall and time moved according to different laws and his middle name hung in the air like incense, like memory, like promise.

Israel.

He said it aloud to his empty apartment, the first time he'd spoken it himself in twenty years.

Israel.

The sound of it like coming home to a place he'd never been.

Like wrestling with something that wanted to bless him but needed him to struggle first, to resist first, to deny first, because the blessing that came too easily wasn't blessing but just luck, and luck ran out but blessing endured, persisted, waited patiently as a rabbi in a study full of books that knew when to fall.

Israel.

His name. His grandfather's name. The name of a nation he'd never visited, a tradition he'd abandoned, a people he'd thought he'd successfully separated himself from until October 7th reminded him that hatred didn't care about his careful distance, that history didn't respect his opted-out status, that blood called to blood whether you answered or not.

But this wasn't about blood, or wasn't only about blood. This was about something else, something the rabbi had seen, something his grandmother had known, something that had been waiting in his name like light in darkness, like darkness in light, like the perpetual twilight of wrestling with angels you didn't believe in until they touched your hip and left you limping, blessed, renamed, returned.

Thursday.

He would go back Thursday.

For now, he had a psalm to not read yet, candlesticks to not light yet, a middle name to learn to speak without flinching.

For now, he had Tuesday night in October in New York, the radiator clanking its own rhythm, the city outside continuing its complex prayer of existence, and somewhere uptown, a rabbi in a study full of books that knew when to fall, waiting patiently for Thursday, for the rivers of Babylon to do their work, for Ethan Israel Stone to remember what he'd never really forgotten, just hidden, like light, like his name, like the way home that had always been there, waiting, patient as Hebrew letters on a page.
