# Chapter 10: The Rabbi

The building at 541 West 77th Street looked like any other Upper West Side brownstone—expensive, historic, weathered by decades of New York winters. Tuesday evening, mid-October, the air carried exhaust and dying leaves and something that made everything feel like the last scene of something or the first scene of something else.

Ethan had walked past three times before stopping.

First pass: 5:47 PM. Just walking, just thinking. Another day of optimization meetings where he'd spoken fluent corporate while Friday's Shabbat service replayed in his mind.

Second pass: 5:56 PM. Checking the card the greeter had pressed into his hand—Rabbi Levi Ben-David, Tuesday Evening Learning, All Levels Welcome, No Experience Necessary. The last line underlined by hand in blue ink.

Third pass: 6:09 PM. Standing at the base of thirty-six steps worn smooth by generations of seekers. The mezuzah on the doorframe caught dying light, the Hebrew letter shin like a three-fingered hand reaching or blessing or warning.

The door opened before he knocked.

"I thought that was you." The secretary, silver-haired with amused eyes, stepped aside. "Third time's the charm. Though in Hebrew, three times makes a chazakah—a presumption of permanence."

"I wasn't—I was just—"

"Walking? Rabbi Levi mentioned you might be walking by tonight. He has a gift for knowing when someone's circling." She glanced at her watch: 6:13 exactly. "He's finishing with another student. Tea?"

The waiting room was everything his startup wasn't—worn wooden floors that creaked with history, walls lined with photographs of rabbis whose eyes measured time differently than quarterly reports. A radiator clanked somewhere, the building's irregular heartbeat.

"Sugar?" She'd returned with tea in a metal holder, Russian style, steam rising like prayers he didn't know.

"No, thank you."

"There are thirty-six cubes if you change your mind. Lamed-vav. The number of hidden righteous ones who sustain the world." She set down a bowl, sugar cubes aligned like tiny white bricks. "Though between you and me, the world could use more than thirty-six these days."

A door opened down the hall. A young woman emerged, looking like she'd been crying but relieved. She nodded at the secretary, glanced at Ethan with the solidarity of fellow travelers, then left, her footsteps light as if she'd set down something heavy.

"You can go in now," the secretary said, though there'd been no summons. "Last door on the right. Don't worry about knocking. Doors that matter open when they're meant to."

The hallway stretched longer than the building should contain. The study door stood ajar, warm light spilling out. Ethan counted eighteen seconds before pushing it wider.

"Shalom, Ethan Israel Stone."

The words hit like cold water, like recognition, like coming home to find someone had been keeping the lights on. Rabbi Levi Ben-David stood from behind a desk older than America, hand extended, showing no surprise at Ethan's shock.

"How did you—my middle name. Nobody knows—"

"Your grandmother Rivka knew it. Spoke it six hundred and thirteen times by my count." The rabbi was younger than expected, maybe fifty, beard more pepper than salt, eyes like libraries. "She was my teacher's student in Brooklyn. Before the Parkinson's. When she remembered everything, especially the grandson who was going to change the world."

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves rose like walls of compressed wisdom—Hebrew, English, Aramaic, German, Arabic. The rabbi gestured to a chair that looked comfortable enough to fall asleep in or uncomfortable enough to stay awake for important conversations.

"She talked about me?"

"To everyone who would listen. 'My Ethan,' she'd say. Said you had a Jewish soul in exile from itself."

The rabbi poured tea from a samovar, steam forming shapes like letters before dissolving. The clock showed 7:18, which couldn't be right—it hadn't been an hour since arrival.

"So," Rabbi Levi said, settling carefully into his chair, wincing. "Sorry, old back injury. Wrestling. Actual wrestling, not the metaphorical kind. What brought your soul here?"

"I'm not religious."

"Neither was Moses when the bush caught fire." He fumbled with his glasses, cleaning them on his shirt—missed a spot, tried again. "What's calling you?"

"October 7th."

"No. October 7th woke something. But you can't wake what isn't there. What was already there, Ethan Israel Stone?"

The radiator clanked seven times. The books seemed to lean in.

"I don't know who I am."

"Good. Most people think they know, which prevents them from becoming who they're supposed to be. Not knowing is the beginning of wisdom. Socrates said that, though he probably stole it from the Jews."

Rabbi Levi pulled a volume from the shelf—Sefer Yetzirah, binding held with tape. "The hidden light, ohr haganuz." He opened to a page marked with a grocery receipt. "Your depression—and yes, I can see it. Keep taking medication if you're on it. I'm not that kind of doctor. But sometimes depression is the soul in exile from itself."

"How do you—"

"Know that look? Practice. Half my congregants are on something. Including me. Sertraline, ten years. Sometimes chemistry helps. But sometimes what feels like depression is grief for a self we've never met."

A book fell from a shelf—actually fell, no earthquake, no vibration. It landed open between them, page 124 visible, Hebrew text pulsing with meaning.

"The Zohar," Rabbi Levi said, not moving to pick it up. "Printed in Mantua, 1558. That section's about names. Your name, Ethan, adds up to 124 in gematria."

"Books don't just—"

"Fall at convenient times? No. But this room has its own weather." The overhead light flickered three times, steadied. "Sit, sit. You're making me nervous standing there like you might bolt."

Ethan sat. The chair embraced him like it had been waiting.

The rabbi handed him a photocopied page. Psalm 137. By the rivers of Babylon.

"Read this Thursday. Don't try to understand it, just let it speak. Language is technology, Ethan. Hebrew especially. The letters aren't just symbols, they're codes. They run in the background once installed."

"You're comparing Torah to software?"

"Why not? Both are systems for processing reality." His phone buzzed. He glanced, frowned. "Sorry, my daughter. Crisis about her bat mitzvah Torah portion. Sixteen texts about whether Leviticus relates to climate change." He typed quickly, mistyped, tried again with one finger. "Where were we?"

Through the door, footsteps—another student waiting.

"Come back Thursday. After you've read it. We'll study properly then."

"You said my grandmother spoke my name six hundred thirteen times."

"The number of mitzvot. Commandments, though that's a terrible translation. Connections, really. Points of contact between finite and infinite. Your grandmother did them all through speaking your name. Made you holy through repetition. Very Jewish, turning anxiety into prayer."

Outside, October had turned properly cold. The thirty-six steps down felt different—not descent but integration.

The N train came immediately. Nearly empty except for an elderly Black woman reading a Hebrew Bible, Koren edition with Rashi commentary.

She looked up, studied his face. "You've been to see the rabbi."

"How did you—"

"You have that look. Scrambled but settling. Like an egg that's been whisked but starting to cook. He's good, Rabbi Levi. Forty years ago when I was converting, everyone said a Black woman had no business with Torah. He said Torah had business with me. Different. Everything."

At 14th Street, she stood to exit. "That paper in your pocket. Psalm 137. My first assignment too, forty years ago. Still makes me cry. The good kind, though. The kind that waters things so they can grow."

His apartment looked the same but felt different. The grandmother's candlesticks sat on the dining table where he'd placed them after Friday's service, tarnished silver waiting to hold light.

He set the psalm beside them, Hebrew side up, letters mysterious but insistent.

His phone buzzed. Aaron: "Dude, where are you? $5 wells until 9."

"Can't make it. Something came up."

"What could possibly come up on a Tuesday?"

He looked at the psalm, the candlesticks, his reflection in the dark window—a man who looked exactly like him but different. Older maybe, or younger, or just more himself than three hours ago when he'd stood counting those thirty-six steps.

Thursday, the rabbi had said. Come back Thursday.

Ethan looked at his calendar—three meetings about user engagement. He selected all three, clicked decline.

"Israel," he said aloud to his empty apartment. First time in twenty years.

"Israel."

The sound of it like coming home to a place he'd never been.

Thursday. He would go back Thursday.

For now, he had a psalm to not read yet, candlesticks to not light yet, a middle name to learn to speak without flinching.

For now, Tuesday night in October, the radiator clanking its own rhythm, the city continuing its complex prayer of existence, and somewhere uptown, a rabbi in a study where books knew when to fall, waiting patiently for Thursday, for the rivers of Babylon to do their work, for Ethan Israel Stone to remember what he'd never really forgotten, just hidden, like light, like his name, like the way home.
