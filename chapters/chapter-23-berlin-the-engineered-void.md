# Chapter 23: Berlin — The Engineered Void

The Jewish Museum's void stretched three stories, and Ethan felt nothing.

December in Berlin. The void rose through the museum like an architectural scream, concrete walls at impossible angles.

Ethan stood at the rail, perfectly calm. Below: nothing. Above: nothing. He'd expected to feel something—grief, rage, recognition. Instead, just the numbness that had started in Athens and deepened in Rome. His body protecting him from one museum of absence too many.

"You're American?"

A guard—young, trained to watch for people who stood too long at edges.

"I don't know anymore."

"Museum closes in one hour."

An hour to not understand the incomprehensible. How Berlin could be both Beethoven and Buchenwald. The Wannsee Conference where fifteen men had lunched—soup, chicken, potatoes, wine.

Outside, Thursday afternoon Berlin: cyclists, outdoor cafés despite the cold, construction cranes building futures on ground that would never be clean. Platform 17 at Grunewald station. The S-Bahn carried commuters now, same trains that had carried Jews to collection points.

The platform's inscriptions: "October 18, 1941: 1,089 Jews to Łódź. October 24, 1941: 896 Jews to Łódź."

Each number a person with a suitcase, a coat, hope that Łódź meant resettlement.

Third panel: "December 9, 1942: 994 Jews to Auschwitz."

His grandmother's family name in the archives. Transport 46.

"You are researching family?"

An elderly woman, German accent but Jewish cadence. She leaned on a walker, each movement calculated to conserve energy.

"My grandmother's cousins. December transport."

"Ah. Winter transports." She shifted weight, winced. "No heat. Many died before arrival. Perhaps a mercy."

"I am Hannah Weiss."

He recognized the name—survivor, author, the woman who'd returned to Berlin in 1950.

"But why stay? Why not go to America, Israel?"

Hannah was quiet for a long moment. "You think I'm brave? A saint?" She laughed, short and bitter. "I stayed because I was afraid to leave. Afraid to start over somewhere else, learn new language, new subway system. Fear, not courage." She pointed at a photo on the mantle—younger Hannah with a man in uniform. "My American soldier. Wanted to marry me, take me to Iowa. Corn fields far as you can see, he said. No history, no ghosts. I was terrified. What if I forgot how to be afraid? What if I became normal?"

Her apartment in Charlottenburg. Same building from her childhood. She moved slowly, counting pills into a weekly organizer—heart medication, blood pressure, the pharmacy of survival. The furniture modern but the walls remembered.

"Your grandmother, from Poland? The Polish Jews who came to Berlin, very—" She knocked over her tea reaching for sugar. "Scheiße. My hands are useless." Ethan helped clean up. She waved him away, irritated. "No, leave it. I can—well, maybe not. Thank you. Where was I? Culture, yes. They loved Wagner. Can you imagine? Wagner! After everything, still Wagner."

"Do you hate them? The Germans?"

Hannah's hands stilled. "I try to. I practice hating them. Stand in mirrors, make angry faces." She demonstrated—lips pulled back, eyes narrowed. "But I'm terrible at it. Always was. Even in the camp, I was better at hiding than hating." She shrugged. "My neighbor Greta—sweet girl, brings me soup. Her grandfather was SS. We both know. Sometimes I catch myself liking her anyway. Failure of character, maybe."

Her arm showed numbers, faded but visible.

"October 7th." She stared at nothing. "You want to know if it's the same. It's not—well, maybe. No. It's the rhyme. History doesn't repeat, it rhymes. Kill the Jews. Always the same poem, different verses."

Outside, Berlin's December darkness. This apartment had been Aryanized, this street renamed. Hannah had survived on potatoes and the promise of return.

Hannah pulled out a photo album, pages yellow with age. "Look," she said, pointing to a young woman in a sundress. "Pretty, yes? That was me, 1951. Trying to look normal." She flipped pages. "Here, 1962. Dancing at someone's wedding. 1974, my apartment warming party. See? I learned to laugh again."

She closed the album. "But the bread here is still terrible. That hasn't changed."

That night, sleepless, Ethan walked Berlin.

His phone buzzed. David, Israeli in Berlin: "Hannah gave me your number. Want to meet? Show you the real Jewish Berlin?"

Next morning, a café in Mitte where young Israelis clustered. David: twenty-eight, designer clothes, tech startup confidence. Around them, Hebrew conversations, Tel Aviv accents. A woman at the next table worked on her laptop, IDF service pin on her bag.

"Why Berlin?" Ethan asked directly. "Of all places."

David's confidence faltered. "Freedom, I guess. No rockets, no—"

"Built on Jewish graves."

"Everything is built on graves." David's voice got defensive. "Tel Aviv on Palestinian villages. The question is what you build next."

"But why here? Why not Paris, London, New York?"

Silence. David stirred his coffee too long. "You want honesty? It's cheaper. My startup failed, my savings are gone. Berlin rent is affordable, the scene is good, and I can pretend I'm here for philosophical reasons instead of financial ones." He looked up, defiant. "There. Happy?"

Ethan studied him. "So it's not about freedom. It's about bankruptcy."

"Fuck you." David stood, then sat back down. "That's not—it's both, okay? I can't afford Tel Aviv and I can't stomach another war. So I came to the place that killed my great-grandparents because the rent is cheap and the Wi-Fi is fast. Make of that what you want."

He glanced around the café, then leaned forward, voice dropping. "You want to know the truth? Every morning I wake up guilty. Not for Gaza—that's complicated. Guilty for being here. In Berlin. Drinking their coffee, speaking their language better than Hebrew now. My sabba—" His voice caught. "My grandfather survived Kristallnacht. Barely escaped to Baghdad. And here I am, voluntary exile to the place that tried to erase us." He laughed, hollow. "What kind of Jew does that make me?"

Two women entered speaking Hebrew, kissed David on both cheeks. He brightened, desperate for the distraction. One wore a Magen David necklace openly. The other had a tattoo in Hebrew: "To live is to resist."

"You see?" David said, but his voice carried doubt now. "We're not hiding."

"Yet."

After they left, David stared at his empty cup. "My parents keep asking when I'm coming home. But what's home? Tel Aviv where I check for rockets, or Berlin where I check for—other things?" He pushed the cup away. "Sometimes at night I dream I'm apologizing to my grandfather. In Arabic, which is fucked up because he spoke Hebrew. But in the dreams, I'm begging forgiveness in the language they drove him from. When I wake up, the apartment feels like a betrayal. Beautiful hardwood floors, probably stolen from some Jewish family in '38. But the rent is cheap and the wifi is fast, so—" He shrugged, the gesture broken.

Wannsee. The villa where fifteen men had planned genocide over lunch. Lake Wannsee sparkled beyond manicured gardens.

Ethan found himself laughing. Not hysteria—just ordinary laughter at the absurdity. Families picnicking where mass murder was designed. Children feeding ducks in water that reflected bureaucratic evil. The laughter felt wrong, inappropriate, but he couldn't stop.

A guard approached, concerned. "Are you alright?"

"Perfect," Ethan said, wiping his eyes. "Absolutely perfect."

He walked away still chuckling, horrifying himself with his own reaction.

That night, his grandmother's yahrzeit. December 2nd. A tea light from the hotel lobby, the flame steady and small.

He didn't say Kaddish. Didn't pull up translations on his phone. Just sat with the candle, watching shadows shift on the wall.

*I don't know how to mourn you properly,* he thought. *But I know how to sit with you.*

The flame reflected in the window, Berlin lights beyond. She'd never seen this city, never had to reconcile Schubert with Treblinka. Maybe that was mercy.

The candle burned down to wax. His body had begun storing tension in strange places—behind his left shoulder blade, in his jaw, in the space between his ribs. Sleep came in fragments, interrupted by dreams he couldn't remember but that left him exhausted.

Hannah persisted. David escaped. And Ethan? Ethan collected names and stones and testimonies, unsure what to do with them all.

Family names from the databases:
- Ruchel Steinberg, Auschwitz, 1942
- Her children: Sarah (6), David (4), Miriam (18 months)

Platform 17 at dawn. The commemorative panels stretched along the platform where deportation trains had waited.

Ethan placed stones—not twenty-three, just two. One for his grandmother's cousin Ruchel. One for all the children whose names were lost.

A maintenance worker approached. "You family?"

"Distant," Ethan said.

"Ah." The man nodded. "They come sometimes. Leave stones, flowers. Always cleaning up after remembering."

His phone buzzed.

Text from his mother: "Are you okay?"

He pocketed the phone without answering. Another buzz.

Text from Aaron: "Where the fuck are you?"

The 7:20 to Kraków waited at the platform. Through Oświęcim—Auschwitz.

Ethan's phone buzzed. David: "Stay another day. Purim party tonight. Three hundred Jews in Berlin—that means something, right?"

Another text, from his mother: "Dad's worried. Call when you can."

He could stay. Join David's party, pretend Jewish Berlin was revival instead of escape. Or fly home, tell everyone about the cobblestone streets and the museums, edit out the complicated parts.

The train doors closed. Through the window, a young woman with a Star of David necklace caught his eye—one of the Berlin Jews, heading somewhere normal. Work, probably. Lunch with friends. An ordinary Tuesday.

Ethan watched the train pull away. 

He wasn't ready to be ordinary yet. The names in his notebook—Ruchel, her children—they'd never had the luxury of choosing whether to continue. 

The next train left at 9:15. He bought a ticket.
