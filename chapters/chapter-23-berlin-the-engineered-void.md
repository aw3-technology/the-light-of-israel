# Chapter 23: Berlin — The Engineered Void

The Jewish Museum's void stretched three stories of empty space, and Ethan heard his grandmother's silence echo.

Early December 2023. Berlin spreading gray beneath a sky that couldn't decide between rain and snow. The void—architect Libeskind called it that, literally—rose through the museum like a throat that had screamed itself empty, concrete walls at angles that hurt to perceive.

Ethan gripped the safety rail, knuckles white. Below: nothing. Above: nothing. The space where Jewish Berlin had been deleted.

"You're American?"

A guard—young, trained to watch for people who stood too long at edges.

"I don't know anymore."

"Museum closes in one hour."

An hour to not understand the incomprehensible. How Berlin could be both Beethoven and Buchenwald. The Wannsee Conference where fifteen men had lunched—soup, chicken, potatoes, wine.

Outside, Thursday afternoon Berlin: cyclists, outdoor cafés despite the cold, construction cranes building futures on ground that would never be clean. Platform 17 at Grunewald station. The S-Bahn carried commuters now, same trains that had carried Jews to collection points.

The platform's inscriptions: "October 18, 1941: 1,089 Jews to Łódź. October 24, 1941: 896 Jews to Łódź."

Each number a person with a suitcase, a coat, hope that Łódź meant resettlement.

Third panel: "December 9, 1942: 994 Jews to Auschwitz."

His grandmother's family name in the archives. Transport 46.

"You are researching family?"

An elderly woman, German accent but Jewish cadence. She leaned on a walker, each movement calculated to conserve energy.

"My grandmother's cousins. December transport."

"Ah. Winter transports." She shifted weight, winced. "No heat. Many died before arrival. Perhaps a mercy."

"I am Hannah Weiss."

He recognized the name—survivor, author, the woman who'd returned to Berlin in 1950.

"Why did you come back?"

"Someone had to be the Jewish presence in the—what do you call it?" She adjusted her hearing aid with trembling fingers. "The absence. Make them see us every day. My existence—" She paused, lost her thought. "What was I saying?"

*How does she do it?* Ethan wondered. *Live here, breathe this air, buy bread from their children?* He felt ashamed of his own comfort, his American distance from consequence.

Her apartment in Charlottenburg. Same building from her childhood. She moved slowly, counting pills into a weekly organizer—heart medication, blood pressure, the pharmacy of survival. The furniture modern but the walls remembered.

"Your grandmother, from Poland? The Polish Jews who came to Berlin, very—" She knocked over her tea reaching for sugar. "Scheiße. My hands are useless." Ethan helped clean up. She waved him away, irritated. "No, leave it. I can—well, maybe not. Thank you. Where was I? Culture, yes. They loved Wagner. Can you imagine? Wagner! After everything, still Wagner."

"Do you hate them? The Germans?"

"Hate is—" She paused, struggled with a jar of jam, her arthritis making her fingers useless. "This stupid jar. My neighbor opens them for me. Nice woman. Her grandfather was—we don't discuss it." She gave up on the jar. "Every time I buy bread, I think—all the dead ones, they can't buy bread. So I buy bread. But the bread here is terrible. Have you tried the pumpernickel? Awful."

Her arm showed numbers, faded but visible.

"October 7th." She stared at nothing. "You want to know if it's the same. It's not—well, maybe. No. It's the rhyme. History doesn't repeat, it rhymes. Kill the Jews. Always the same poem, different verses."

Outside, Berlin's December darkness. This apartment had been Aryanized, this street renamed. Hannah had survived on potatoes and the promise of return.

"Sometimes I dream I'm still in that—" She stopped. "No, that's not—I dream normal things. Missing the U-Bahn. But I wake up thinking I smell—his cigarettes, her cabbage soup. The couple who—" She rubbed her wrists. "I still eat too fast. Hide food. Yogurt behind books. Last week I found a sandwich in my coat from—when? 1987? Petrified." She laughed. "Like me."

She wrote down a guide's name for Auschwitz, her handwriting shaky. Crossed it out, wrote another. "No, he died. Use this one." She took her evening pills, miscounted, started over. "Close enough. Getting old is—what was I saying? Revenge. They wanted me dead at fourteen. I'm ninety-three. Still here. Still buying their terrible bread."

That night, sleepless, Ethan walked Berlin.

His phone buzzed. David, Israeli in Berlin: "Hannah gave me your number. Want to meet? Show you the real Jewish Berlin?"

Next morning, a café in Mitte where young Israelis clustered. David: twenty-eight, designer clothes, tech startup confidence. Around them, Hebrew conversations, Tel Aviv accents. A woman at the next table worked on her laptop, IDF service pin on her bag.

"Berlin is freedom," David said. "No rockets, no reserve duty, no—"

"Built on Jewish graves."

"Everything is built on graves. Tel Aviv on Palestinian villages. The question is what you build."

"And what is Berlin building?"

"The future. Look around—" He gestured at the café full of young Jews. "Israelis, Americans, even some Germans converting. There's a Purim party next week. Three hundred people expected. Jewish Berlin is alive."

"With armed guards."

David's enthusiasm cracked. "Since October 7th, yes. Doubled security. My neighbor—sweet German girl—asked if I felt 'responsible' for Gaza." He laughed bitterly. "I told her my grandparents were from Iraq. The Farhud. She didn't know what that was." He stirred his coffee, suddenly looking younger. "Sometimes I wonder if I'm just hiding here. From reserve duty, from—everything."

He glanced around the café, then leaned forward, voice dropping. "You want to know the truth? Every morning I wake up guilty. Not for Gaza—that's complicated. Guilty for being here. In Berlin. Drinking their coffee, speaking their language better than Hebrew now. My sabba—" His voice caught. "My grandfather survived Kristallnacht. Barely escaped to Baghdad. And here I am, voluntary exile to the place that tried to erase us." He laughed, hollow. "What kind of Jew does that make me?"

Two women entered speaking Hebrew, kissed David on both cheeks. He brightened, desperate for the distraction. One wore a Magen David necklace openly. The other had a tattoo in Hebrew: "To live is to resist."

"You see?" David said, but his voice carried doubt now. "We're not hiding."

"Yet."

After they left, David stared at his empty cup. "My parents keep asking when I'm coming home. But what's home? Tel Aviv where I check for rockets, or Berlin where I check for—other things?" He pushed the cup away. "Sometimes at night I dream I'm apologizing to my grandfather. In Arabic, which is fucked up because he spoke Hebrew. But in the dreams, I'm begging forgiveness in the language they drove him from. When I wake up, the apartment feels like a betrayal. Beautiful hardwood floors, probably stolen from some Jewish family in '38. But the rent is cheap and the wifi is fast, so—" He shrugged, the gesture broken.

That afternoon: Wannsee. The villa where fifteen men had designed hell. The lake was beautiful—families sailing where genocide had been engineered. Cold air carried damp leaves and diesel from a service truck. Ethan's stomach cramped, sharp pain climbing his ribs. He vomited beside roses—bile, coffee, metal on his tongue.

A guard offered water. "Are you ill?"

"I'm Jewish."

As if that explained everything. The vomiting, the chest pain, the way his hands shook. *What am I doing here?* Ethan thought. *What am I looking for?* Hannah's persistence, David's freedom—both seemed impossible. He was neither survivor nor escape artist. Just a tourist of his own family's destruction.

That night, his grandmother's yahrzeit. December 2nd. A tea light from the hotel lobby. He pulled up Kaddish on his phone, squinting at the Hebrew characters. *Yitgadal v'yitkadash...* The words felt foreign in his mouth, consonants he'd never learned properly. He stumbled on *sh'mei raba*, the melody escaping him completely—was it the Ashkenazi tune or Sephardic? His voice cracked on the unfamiliar syllables, reduced to reading phonetic English approximations. *What kind of Jew am I,* he thought, *that I need Google to mourn my grandmother?* The prayer that never mentioned death but sanctified God's name despite everything—except he wasn't sure he was saying it right, wasn't sure God was listening, wasn't sure he deserved to speak these ancient words in this cursed city. *She never saw this place,* he thought. *Never had to reconcile the music with the machinery. Lucky her.*

The candle flame reflected in the window. His body ached—shoulders, jaw. He'd been grinding his teeth, noticed blood on his pillow that morning. *What am I becoming?* The thought scared him. Hannah had survived this place. David had chosen it. But Ethan felt himself dissolving, becoming absence like the museum's void.

Family names from the databases:
- Ruchel Steinberg, Auschwitz, 1942
- Her children: Sarah (6), David (4), Miriam (18 months)

Morning. Platform 17 before dawn. He placed twenty-three stones, one for each murdered family member. His hands trembled—cold or something else. The tremor had started in Berlin, growing worse each day.

*What am I doing?* The stones felt meaningless, a tourist's ritual. Hannah lived with this every day. David ran from it. And Ethan? Ethan collected names like souvenirs of suffering.

His phone buzzed.

Text from his mother: "Are you okay?"

He pocketed the phone without answering. Another buzz.

Text from Aaron: "Where the fuck are you?"

The 7:20 to Kraków approached, its headlight cutting through the gray dawn. Through Oświęcim, which the Germans had renamed Auschwitz. Should he board? Continue this archaeological dig through horror?

A third buzz. David: "Purim party Thursday. You should come back."

*Come back.* To what? To Brooklyn coffee shops and startup metrics? To protests and arguments about who suffered more? To David's guilt-ridden exile? To Aaron's righteous fury?

The train's brakes hissed. Passengers stepped on and off. Normal people with normal destinations.

Ethan stood alone now, phone silent in his pocket, stones heavy in his palm. Behind him: Berlin where Hannah counted pills and refused to disappear. Ahead: whatever waited in Poland.

*I could go back,* he thought. *Catch a flight to New York. Pretend this was enough.*

But the names in his notebook wouldn't let him. Twenty-three stones, twenty-three people who'd stood on this platform with suitcases and hope.

His legs carried him toward the train. Not from courage. From the simple inability to stop. That night he slept in snatches, Berlin air seeping through the window seals, dreams thin and sharp as wire.
