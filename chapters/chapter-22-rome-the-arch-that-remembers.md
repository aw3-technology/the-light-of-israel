# Chapter 22: Rome — The Arch That Remembers

The Arch of Titus still stood in Rome, celebrating Jerusalem's destruction, and Ethan felt two thousand years collapse into now.

November rain had cleared the Forum of tourists, leaving him alone with the monument. The marble had weathered to the color of old bones, but the relief inside the arch remained clear: Roman soldiers carrying the Temple's golden menorah—seven branches, each as tall as a man. SPQR carved above. Below, barely visible, someone had scratched modern Hebrew: עם ישראל חי. The people of Israel live.

Ethan stood where Jewish slaves had been marched through. His chest tightened, ribs pressing against something that wanted out. The easy Jerusalem tears were gone. This felt different. Heavier.

"We don't walk under it."

The voice came from behind him—American accent wrestling with Italian intonations. A group of Israeli tourists, their guide pointing at the arch with casual authority.

"Jews have never walked under the Arch of Titus. Not for two thousand years. We walk around it. Because they thought they destroyed us, but look—" he gestured at his group, teenagers draped in Israeli flags, "—we're here and Rome's a tourist attraction."

One teenager started humming Hatikvah. The others joined. Water streamed down Ethan's face—rain or tears, impossible to distinguish.

"You're Jewish." Not a question. The guide had approached. "First time?"

"First time really understanding what it means."

The guide—Daniel from Queens—nodded. "There's someone you should meet. Michele Della Rocca. His family's been in Rome since before the destruction. Tell him Daniel sent you."

Via del Portico d'Ottavia still bore the ghetto's shape, compressed by centuries of forced density. The Great Synagogue's aluminum dome caught late sun—built deliberately tall in 1904, to be seen from the Vatican.

Piperno occupied the corner, same location since 1860. Wall photographs showed the restaurant boarded up in 1938, American GIs eating there in 1944.

"Daniel called. Said you stood at the arch and..." Michele emerged from the kitchen, flour under his fingernails, oil burns mapping forty years at the fryer. Sixty-something, Roma tattoo visible under his rolled sleeve. "Ah, you did more than weep. I can see it."

"I don't know what I—"

"Doesn't matter. Sit. You need to eat."

The carciofi arrived—whole artichokes deep-fried until they opened like bronze flowers. "Oil has to be exactly right," Michele said, watching bubbles. "My family's made these since... eh, who knows? Before your Jesus, before their Christ."

Ethan bit into the artichoke. The texture was wrong—too tender, almost meaty. "This doesn't taste like..."

"Like what you expected? Good. Nothing here is what you expect." Michele poured wine. "We've been here since before Rome thought it owned the world. Watched Caesar die. Watched the Popes. Watched Mussolini march. Still here."

"But the destruction—the Temple—"

"Yes, they destroyed it. Carried the treasures through that arch." Michele leaned forward, oil burns catching light. "You know where those treasures are?"

"The Vatican?"

"Maybe. Or the Tiber—fell in during some medieval riot, waiting in the mud." Michele shrugged. "But the real treasure got out. The... eh, what's the word? The presence. Went into exile with us. They stole our gold but..." He gestured vaguely. "You understand?"

Ethan didn't, but nodded anyway. The restaurant filled with Thursday regulars. Two lawyers arguing in Romanesco, switching to Hebrew for punchlines. A grandmother feeding her grandson, complaining he was too thin.

"Tomorrow, Shabbat. You come. But today—" Michele wiped his hands on his apron. "You need to see the Vatican. See what they did with our God."

The Vatican felt like accumulated guilt made marble. Ethan had expected anger. Instead, he felt pity mixed with recognition—like seeing a child playing with stolen toys, not understanding what they'd taken.

Father Antonio found him in the Sistine Chapel. Young priest, maybe thirty-five, studying the brain-shaped cloud surrounding God.

"You're looking for the Hebrew."

"Can you see it?"

"I study Jewish-Christian relations. How we became we by defining ourselves against you." The priest's accent was Spanish, maybe Portuguese. "Rabbi Di Segni teaches me. Last week, someone asked why Jews can't just accept Jesus. The rabbi said, 'Look outside. Is the world redeemed?'" He shrugged. "No answer."

They walked past 'preserved' Jewish manuscripts. Father Antonio stopped before a marble fragment. "From a Roman synagogue. First century. The Pope keeps saying he'll return these things." He looked tired. "Institutions move slowly. Especially ones that think they're eternal."

"Do you believe that?"

"I believe God's relationship with the Jewish people is eternal. Everything else is..." He made a vague gesture. "Politics."

That evening, Michele's grandmother held court at table seven. Ninety-three, wearing Bulgari earrings—"from before," she always said. She'd survived October 16, 1943, hidden in the hospital on Tiber Island.

"I was twenty," she said in practiced English. "Pretty. My Samuel fixed watches—Orologi Limentani, you can still see the sign. The Germans came at 5:30 AM, Shabbat morning. Took over a thousand. Sixteen came back. Not Samuel."

She grabbed Ethan's hand with fingers like living parchment. "You're searching. All young Jews who come here are. But the permission is already here—in the persistence. Not some miracle oil lasting eight days. That's poetry. The miracle is me serving artichokes to you in 2023."

But something in Ethan resisted the easy comfort. "What if persistence isn't enough? What if we're just... stubborn survivors clinging to something that should have died naturally?"

The table went quiet. Michele's daughter looked up from her phone. The grandmother's grip tightened.

"You think survival is accident?" Her voice sharpened. "You think we stayed because we were too stupid to leave? I had three chances to go to America. My brother went to Argentina in '39. Smart man. Rich man. Dead man—heart attack at sixty, never had children. I stayed in Rome with the Fascists, with the war, with the priests calling us Christ-killers. You know why?"

Ethan shook his head.

"Because somebody has to tend the flame. Somebody has to remember the recipes." She released his hand. "You want to quit being Jewish? Fine. Others tried. But don't call it wisdom. Call it what it is—fear."

Friday afternoon, Ethan helped in the kitchen, feeling the old woman's words like splinters. Michele's family arrived in waves—daughter from Parioli, son from Monteverde, cousins who ran jewelry stores. They argued about football, traffic, whether cousin David's girlfriend was Jewish enough. The complexity of it made Ethan's chest tight. Where did he fit in this tangle of generations, arguments, assumptions?

When the sun set, Michele's wife lit candles. Same words he'd heard in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Brooklyn—now with Roman intonation. Through the window, couples strolled along the Tiber, beautiful and indifferent to the history it held in its mud.

After dinner, after songs, Michele asked, "You understand now?"

"I'm more confused than when I started."

"Good. Confusion is the beginning. Americans want the answer. Jews learn to live in the question."

Saturday night, Ethan returned to the Forum. A Birthright group took photos. Two couples walked wide around the arch—muscle memory of avoidance. Others sang, harmonies building against lit marble.

Ethan photographed himself standing beyond the arch, looking back. Not triumphant—triumph was Roman. Just present.

He texted the photo to Sera: "Still standing."

She responded: "That's all we ever do. Come home."

Home. The word felt different now. Heavier. More complicated.

Sunday morning, Michele handed him a package—recipe cards in faded handwriting.

"For your children, when you have them. Tell them this: we were too tough to digest. Now they eat our food and don't know it's Jewish. That's not revenge. That's..." Michele paused, looking for words. "That's Italy."

The train pulled away from Termini, past EUR's fascist architecture—Mussolini's 'Third Rome,' now hosting tech companies. Through the window: umbrella pines and November light, beauty that persisted alongside everything else.

His phone buzzed. Sera: "How was Rome?"

"Complicated."

"Good. Simple places don't teach anything."

Outside: Lazio becoming Tuscany, vineyards and hilltop towns. In four hours he'd cross into Germany. Toward Berlin, where his grandmother's family had lived before they became smoke.

The recipes in his bag were stained with oil, annotated in three languages. One note: "More salt after 1967—we won the war." These small rebellions.

The train entered a tunnel through the Apennines. In the darkness, Ethan saw his reflection superimposed on black—his face going north toward the harder history, the one without Rome's consolations.

Behind him, Rome continued. The arch still stood. The Jews still stood. Both facts equally unlikely. The train climbed toward Germany, carrying questions that had no easy answers.
