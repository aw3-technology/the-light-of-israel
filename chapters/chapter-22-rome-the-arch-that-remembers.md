# Chapter 22: Rome — The Arch That Remembers

The Arch of Titus still stood in Rome, celebrating Jerusalem's destruction, and Ethan felt two thousand years collapse into now.

November rain cleared the Forum, leaving him alone with the monument. Marble the color of old bone; inside the arch, Roman soldiers carrying the Temple’s golden menorah—seven branches as tall as men. SPQR above. Below, barely visible, modern Hebrew scratched: עם ישראל חי. The people of Israel live.

I stood where Jewish slaves had been marched through, feeling the weight of their chains in my own limbs, phantom iron around wrists that had never known bondage except the kind I'd chosen. My chest tightened, ribs pressing against something that wanted out—not tears but testimony, not grief but defiance. The easy Jerusalem tears were gone. This felt different. Heavier. Like inheriting a debt that could never be paid, only passed forward.

"We don't walk under it."

The voice came from behind him—American accent wrestling with Italian intonations. A group of Israeli tourists, their guide pointing at the arch with casual authority.

"Jews don’t walk under the Arch of Titus. Two thousand years. We walk around." He gestured at teenagers draped in Israeli flags. "They thought they destroyed us. We’re here. Rome’s a tourist site."

One teenager started humming Hatikvah. The others joined. Water streamed down Ethan's face—rain or tears, impossible to distinguish.

"You're Jewish." Not a question. The guide had approached. "First time?"

"First time really understanding what it means."

The guide—Daniel from Queens—nodded. "There’s someone you should meet—Michele Della Rocca. Family here since before the destruction. Tell him Daniel sent you."

Via del Portico d'Ottavia still bore the ghetto's shape, compressed by centuries of forced density. The Great Synagogue's aluminum dome caught late sun—built deliberately tall in 1904, to be seen from the Vatican.

Piperno occupied the corner, same location since 1860. Wall photographs showed the restaurant boarded up in 1938, American GIs eating there in 1944.

"Daniel called. Said you stood at the arch and..." Michele emerged from the kitchen, flour under his fingernails, oil burns mapping years at the fryer. Roma tattoo under his rolled sleeve. "Ah, you did more than weep. I can see it."

"I don't know what I—"

"Doesn't matter. Sit. You need to eat."

Carciofi arrived—artichokes deep-fried until they opened like bronze flowers. "Oil must be exact," Michele said, watching bubbles. "We’ve made these since… eh, who knows? Before your Jesus, before their Christ."

Ethan bit into the artichoke. The texture was wrong—too tender, almost meaty. "This doesn't taste like..."

"Like what you expected? Good. Nothing here—" Michele poured wine, the bottle clattering against glasses as someone shouted in the kitchen. "Nothing here is what you expect. We've been here since—" A crash of plates. He paused, listening, then relaxed. "Giulia. Still breaking things at twenty-six."

"But the destruction—the Temple—"

"Yes, they destroyed it." Michele's hands gestured, oil burns catching light. "Carried the treasures through that arch. You know where—" 

A waiter rushed past with smoking artichokes. The oil sizzled, drowning out Michele's words. He waited, patient with the rhythm of the kitchen.

"—those treasures are? The Vatican maybe. Or the Tiber—fell in during some riot." He shrugged, wiping oil from his fingers. "But the real treasure got out."

Ethan set down his fork. "But what if it didn't? What if we're just telling ourselves stories to make exile feel like choice?" The words came out sharper than he intended. "I stood at that arch today and all I felt was... loss. Not triumph. Not survival. Just two thousand years of loss."

Michele's smile faded. Around them, the restaurant continued—lawyers arguing, a grandmother feeding her grandson—but something had shifted at their table.

"Tomorrow, Shabbat. You come. Tonight we cook."

That evening, Michele's grandmother held court at table seven. Ninety‑three, sharp eyes, hands that moved when she talked. She'd survived October 16, 1943, hidden in the hospital on Tiber Island.

"I was twenty," she said in practiced English. "Pretty. My Samuel fixed watches—Orologi Limentani, you can still see the sign. The Germans came at 5:30 AM, Shabbat morning. Took over a thousand. Sixteen came back. Not Samuel."

She grabbed Ethan's hand with fingers like parchment. "You're searching. All young Jews who come here are. But the permission—" She stopped, staring past him. "Samuel used to say that. Permission. As if God needed our permission to be God."

Her voice changed, became smaller. "Sometimes I think we stayed out of stubbornness. Pure spite. The Romans said we'd disappear, so we didn't. But what does that prove?" She looked directly at Ethan. "That we were right? Or that we were too stupid to know when we were beaten?"

But something in Ethan resisted even this uncertainty. "What if persistence isn't enough? What if we're just... stubborn survivors clinging to something that should have died naturally?" He paused. "What if this whole journey is just another kind of empty ritual?"

The grandmother's grip tightened. "Empty? You think Samuel died for empty?" Her voice hardened again. "You think I hid in a hospital for three months, eating floor scraps, for empty?" 

Then, quieter: "But maybe you're right. Maybe empty is all we have left. Maybe that's enough."

Giulia set down her phone. "Nonna, he's not asking about quitting. He's asking about meaning. And honestly?" She turned to Ethan. "Your question is more sophisticated than her answer. Persistence for what? To prove Romans wrong? To spite Christians? To maintain genetic purity?" She laughed sharply. "Half my friends are intermarried. Their kids eat prosciutto and light Shabbat candles. Are they failing at being Jewish, or succeeding at being Italian?"

The grandmother's eyes flashed. "Giulia—"

"No, it's fair," Michele interrupted, oil-stained hands gentle on his mother's shoulder. "She asks the questions we don't want to hear." He looked at his daughter. "Tell him what you told the rabbi last week."

Giulia's confidence faltered slightly. "I said... I said maybe Judaism survives best when it stops trying to survive. When it just lives." She gestured toward the window, toward Rome flowing past. "We're not museum pieces. We're not carrying sacred fire. We're just people who happen to make excellent artichokes and remember some very old stories."

Friday afternoon, Ethan helped in the kitchen, both women's words like splinters—the grandmother's ancient certainty, Giulia's modern doubt. Family arrived in waves—daughter from Parioli, son from Monteverde, cousins who ran jewelry stores. Arguments about football, traffic, whether cousin David's girlfriend was Jewish enough.

Giulia appeared beside him, drying wineglasses. "Overwhelming?"

"I came here looking for something solid," Ethan said. "Everyone keeps giving me more questions."

"Good. Questions are portable. Answers just weigh down your luggage." She smiled. "You know what my thesis was on? Legal pluralism in the EU. How different legal systems coexist without destroying each other. Maybe that's what you're really looking for—not the right way to be Jewish, but permission to be Jewish in your own way."

The complexity made his chest tight, but also somehow lighter. Where did he fit in this tangle? Maybe that wasn't the right question either.

When the sun set, Michele's wife lit candles. Same words he'd heard in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Brooklyn—now with Roman intonation. Through the window, couples strolled along the Tiber, beautiful and indifferent to the history it held in its mud.

After dinner, after songs, Michele asked, "You understand now?"

"I'm more confused than when I started."

"Good. Confusion is the beginning. Americans want answers. Jews live in the question."

Saturday night, Ethan returned to the Forum. The arch stood lit, tourists taking photos. He walked around it, not under—old habit or new understanding, he couldn't tell.

Sunday morning, Michele handed him a package—recipe cards in faded handwriting.

"For your children, when you have them."

The train pulled from Termini toward Germany. In his bag, recipes stained with oil, annotated in languages he couldn't read. Outside the window, Italy became a blur of hills and vineyards.

The train entered a tunnel through the mountains. In the darkness, Ethan saw his reflection superimposed on nothing—his face carrying north toward Berlin, toward his grandmother's harder history. 

The recipes weighed nothing. The questions they carried felt heavier than marble.
