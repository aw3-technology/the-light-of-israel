# Chapter 14: Landing After the Siren

His passport trembled in his hands—still cold from the plane's aggressive air conditioning—as the Israeli officer asked, "First time here?"

Ben Gurion Airport, November 15th, 2023, 5:41 AM. The air tasted different already—drier, charged with something between tension and promise. His American passport said "Stone, Ethan Israel" and the young woman behind bulletproof glass studied his middle name for a long moment. Her fingernails clicked against her keyboard, a rapid-fire rhythm like urgent prayer.

"Purpose of visit?" Her English carried Hebrew underneath it, the accent that made questions sound like challenges.

"I don't know."

Wrong answer for immigration. She looked up from his passport, studying his face like a map she'd seen before.

"Family?"

"Dead."

"Tourism?"

"Maybe."

She smiled—tired, knowing. Her stamp came down hard: November 15, 2023.

"Next."

But her hand lingered on his passport an extra second before sliding it back.

The arrivals hall erupted in Hebrew—which mostly sounded like aggressive throat clearing to Ethan's untrained ear. A family reunion blocked the walkway, everyone shouting at once while he tried to squeeze past with his suitcase. Someone's grandmother wore too much perfume that made him sneeze violently. He'd forgotten to exchange money, realized the ATM only had Hebrew instructions, and stood there squinting at symbols that meant nothing. His jet-lagged brain couldn't process which way the exit was. When he asked "English?" to a security guard, the man just pointed vaguely and walked away.

"Taxi? You need taxi?"

Moshe—according to his license, photographed in 1987 when he still had his Moroccan curls, now replaced by a sun-spotted scalp. The Mercedes door handle was sticky with humidity. Inside smelled like Noblesse cigarettes and pine air freshener fighting forty years of accumulated arguments. The vinyl seats were cracked, held together with duct tape that scratched against Ethan's jeans.

"Where to?"

"Tel Aviv. A hotel."

"Any hotel? What are you, rich? I take you to my cousin's place. You look like you need beach."

They passed Lod, where palm trees grew next to Soviet blocks. The air smelled of diesel and jasmine, concrete dust and orange blossoms. Construction cranes everywhere—the archaeology of stubbornness. The sun was already brutal at 6 AM, making the asphalt shimmer like water.

"First time?" Moshe navigated traffic like warfare and ballet simultaneously.

"Yes."

"No. Nobody comes first time now. After October 7th, only family comes. Only Jews. You're Jewish?"

"I'm discovering that."

"Discovering?" Moshe laughed, swerving around a Vespa. "American thing, right? 'I'm finding myself.' My ex-wife found herself in Cyprus with her yoga instructor." He lit a cigarette. "Cost me half my pension in the divorce."

The radio played something Arabic. Moshe switched stations, landed on news. October 7th—he turned the volume down.

"You have family here?"

"No."

"Smart. Mine all moved to Miami. Say it's too dangerous here, meanwhile they won't walk to the grocery store after dark." He flicked ash out the window. "My daughter texts me every hour from South Beach. 'Abba, are you safe?' I text back: 'The humidity here will kill me before the rockets do.'"

Tel Aviv materialized through morning haze—white Bauhaus buildings sun-bleached and salt-worn. A juice bar next to a synagogue next to a sex shop. Everyone on electric scooters.

"The Cinema Hotel, Dizengoff. My cousin Avi's place. Tell him Moshe from Tuesday poker sent you. Don't mention I owe him 800 shekels."

The hotel lobby contained decades—Ottoman tiles, British Mandate furniture, a kibbutz-era mural, WiFi sign in six languages.

"You came now?" The desk clerk handed over a key attached to a plastic palm tree. "After everything?"

"Maybe because of everything."

"Room 418. Elevator's broken, so you take the stairs. Air conditioning works maybe half the time."

---

The room smelled like industrial carpet cleaner and someone else's cigarettes. The bed sagged in the middle, the mini-fridge hummed aggressively, and the bathroom door didn't quite close. The air conditioning wheezed and died within five minutes.

But the window faced west toward the sea.

The Mediterranean stretched out blue and vast. He could smell salt and car exhaust, hear construction and waves. His grandmother had crossed this water in 1941. Now he was here, sweating in a budget hotel room, trying to figure out why.

The beach at Frishman took thirty minutes to reach—Ethan stopping at every Hebrew sign, trying to decode letters that looked like the alphabet of wrestling itself.

Sand already crowded at 7 AM—matkot players, Russian women in swimming caps, Eritrean refugees teaching their kids to swim. The lifeguard tower covered in October 7th memorial stickers, but the lifeguard himself telling jokes, living.

He touched the water—warmer than the Atlantic in July. The Mediterranean didn't care about his dress pants.

"American?" A woman jogged past, slowed down. Hebrew accent thick as honey.

"Yeah. From New York."

"Crazy time to visit." She stretched against a palm tree, looked at his dress shoes on the sand. "First time?"

"Yeah."

She said something in Hebrew that sounded like a question. He stared blankly.

"I said, you look lost." She laughed, not unkindly. "Tel Aviv will teach you, don't worry."

She jogged off before he could ask what that meant.

Café Bucke was all plastic chairs and fluorescent lights. The menu was entirely in Hebrew. Ethan pointed at something, hoped for the best.

"You want this?" The waitress held up the menu, skeptical.

"Yes?"

"You sure? Is very spicy."

What arrived was shakshuka—eggs in tomato sauce that set his mouth on fire. He tried to hide his tears, asked for water in his terrible Hebrew: "Ani rotzeh... water?"

"Mayim," she corrected, bringing him a glass and laughing. "American stomach, yes? You want yogurt?"

The other customers were staring now. His face was bright red, sweat beading on his forehead.

Back in his room, Ethan sat by the window as the sun set over the Mediterranean. The air conditioning had given up entirely, and sweat stuck his shirt to the cheap desk chair. 

From somewhere came the call to prayer, then church bells, then at exactly sunset—the Shabbat siren.

The sound was deeper than he'd expected, more mournful. It held the whole city for one long breath, then faded.

He pulled out his phone to text his mother, typed and deleted several attempts.

Finally: "I'm here. It's loud and confusing and I can't read anything. The food is too spicy. I think I'm supposed to be here."

Send.

Her response came immediately—three dots appearing, disappearing, appearing again. Finally:

"Your grandmother would be proud."

He set the phone down. Tomorrow he'd try to find Rabbi Levi's contact, assuming he could figure out how to work a Hebrew phone directory. Tonight he'd lie on this sagging bed in this overheated room and listen to a city he didn't understand yet.

Through the thin walls, his neighbors were arguing in rapid Hebrew. A motorcycle backfired in the street. Somewhere, someone was playing music too loud.

He was here. That was something.

For the first time in months, he wasn't trying to be anywhere else.
