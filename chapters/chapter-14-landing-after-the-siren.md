# Chapter 14: Landing After the Siren

His passport trembled in his hands as the Israeli officer asked, "First time here?"

Ben Gurion Airport, November 15th, 2023, 5:41 AM. His American passport said "Stone, Ethan Israel" and the young woman behind bulletproof glass studied his middle name for a long moment.

"Purpose of visit?" Her English carried Hebrew underneath it, the accent that made questions sound like challenges.

"I don't know."

Wrong answer for immigration. She looked up from his passport, studying his face like a map she'd seen before.

"Family?"

"Dead."

"Tourism?"

"Maybe."

She smiled—tired, knowing. Her stamp came down hard: November 15, 2023.

"Next."

But her hand lingered on his passport an extra second before sliding it back.

The arrivals hall erupted in Hebrew—a family reuniting with shrieks and kissing of both cheeks, three times, not the European two. A businessman argued into his phone while his other hand conducted an invisible orchestra. Two soldiers, M16s slung casual as backpacks, debated something that sounded violent but was probably falafel. Everyone stood too close, talked too loud, touched too much.

"Taxi? You need taxi?"

Moshe—according to his license, photographed in 1987 when he still had his Moroccan curls. The Mercedes smelled like Noblesse cigarettes and pine air freshener fighting forty years of accumulated arguments.

"Where to?"

"Tel Aviv. A hotel."

"Any hotel? What are you, rich? I take you to my cousin's place. You look like you need beach."

They passed Lod, where palm trees grew next to Soviet blocks. A Bedouin man sold watermelons from a truck marked in Arabic, Hebrew, and Russian. Construction cranes everywhere—the archaeology of stubbornness.

"First time?" Moshe navigated traffic like warfare and ballet simultaneously.

"Yes."

"No. Nobody comes first time now. After October 7th, only family comes. Only Jews. You're Jewish?"

"I'm discovering that."

"Discovering?" Moshe laughed, swerving around a Vespa carrying three people and a washing machine. "My grandmother from Casablanca used to say, 'You can change your name, your nose, your country. But Friday night, the candles know who you are.'"

He hummed along to the radio—not news but Zohar Argov, the Yemenite singer's voice crackling through old speakers. "This song? Ha-Perach BeGani. '82. My wife walked down the aisle to it. Now my daughter plays it on repeat since her boyfriend went to Gaza." He caught Ethan's eye in the mirror. "Zohar died young. But the songs—they stay alive."

The radio switched to news. October 7th—zayin b'October—needed no translation.

"You have family here?"

"No. Maybe. Everyone's family now, right?"

"My daughter, she's at Nova every Friday. Her friend Shani was there. Twenty-two years old." He merged aggressively. "So yes, everyone's family. Family price for you."

Tel Aviv materialized through morning haze—white Bauhaus buildings sun-bleached and salt-worn. A juice bar next to a synagogue next to a sex shop. Everyone on electric scooters.

"The Cinema Hotel, Dizengoff," Moshe announced. "My cousin Avi's place. Tell him Moshe from Tuesday poker sent you. Don't mention I owe him 800 shekels."

The hotel lobby contained decades—Ottoman tiles, British Mandate furniture, a kibbutz-era mural, WiFi sign in six languages.

"You came now?" The desk clerk—maybe twenty-five, maybe just back from service—handed over a key attached to a plastic palm tree. "After everything, you came now?"

"Maybe because of everything."

"Room 613."

The number stopped him for a beat. He pocketed the key.

The room was everything and nothing—bed, desk, bathroom where the shower would alternate between scalding and freezing.

But the window.

The Mediterranean stretched infinite—the same water Jonah had sailed, that refugees had crossed—catching morning light like a blue older than memory.

Ethan opened the window and salt air entered like recognition, like his lungs had been waiting for this specific mixture of sea and exhaust. His cells reorganizing, his grandmother's prayers finally arriving at their destination, forty years late but in Jewish time, exactly on time.

The beach at Frishman took thirty minutes to reach—Ethan stopping at every Hebrew sign, trying to decode letters that looked like the alphabet of wrestling itself.

Sand already crowded at 7 AM—matkot players, Russian women in swimming caps, Eritrean refugees teaching their kids to swim. The lifeguard tower covered in October 7th memorial stickers, but the lifeguard himself telling jokes, living.

He touched the water—warmer than the Atlantic in July. The Mediterranean didn't care about his dress pants.

"American?" A woman jogging past—sports bra and combat boots.

"Is it that obvious?"

"The dress pants in the ocean, yes. Also the crying."

Was he crying? His face was wet—sea spray or sweat or humidity that made Tel Aviv feel like breathing through grief.

"You came after October 7th?"

"I'm figuring it out."

"Nobody knows why they come. But you can tell when someone's arrived. You arriving?"

"I'm arriving."

She jogged on toward Gordon Beach, where the drummers would gather at sunset.

Breakfast at Café Bucke—plastic chairs, fluorescent lights, the owner's grandmother from Thessaloniki watching from a photograph. Menu in Hebrew, additions in Russian, waitress switching between Arabic and English. An Ethiopian family eating injera with shakshuka. Tech workers on laptops, an M16 leaning against one chair.

"You're American." The waiter, unnecessary sunglasses, affected casualness hiding recent intensity.

"Yes."

"Jewish American, yeah? After October 7th..." He shrugged, wiped down glasses. "Different now. You feel it?"

Ethan nodded without thinking.

The shakshuka came in a scratched skillet. Coffee in a glass, Turkish style with milk foam—the Israeli inability to choose between traditions.

Ethan pointed at the Hebrew menu, attempted the words: "Ani rotzeh... shakshuka?"

The waiter grinned. "Your Hebrew—terrible. But you tried. That's something."

"How long you stay?"

"Maybe a week? Not sure yet."

"Nobody makes plans past tomorrow now. But tomorrow—Abu Hassan's hummus in Jaffa. Best in the country. Cash only."

Back in room 613, Ethan sat on his balcony as sun descended toward the Mediterranean. The muezzin's call from Jaffa, 5:47 PM. Church bells. Then the Shabbat siren. Sacred and profane coexisting in a strange truce.

That afternoon, he bought Hebrew flashcards from a kiosk, practiced basic words while walking. שלום. תודה. סליחה. Hello. Thank you. Excuse me. His pronunciation was terrible, but he kept trying.

The city lights flickered on—Dizengoff neon, Rothschild cafes, bars on Nahalat Binyamin already thumping. Everyone pretending Tuesday's rocket hadn't happened.

Tomorrow, Jaffa. Tomorrow, Rabbi Levi's contact—the number written on hotel stationery.

Tonight, Ethan Israel Stone sat on a balcony in Tel Aviv, not fleeing from the wrestling. The Mediterranean held light like memory. Tomorrow was possible because Jews had been practicing tomorrow for three thousand years.

Below, delivery bikes ran red lights. Someone's grandmother watered geraniums. A cat colony gathered.

He pulled out his phone, started typing to his mother: "Made it to Tel Aviv. It's..." He deleted that, tried again: "I'm here. More complicated than expected." Deleted that too.

Finally: "I arrived."

His thumb hovered over Send. The message sat there, cursor blinking.

Outside his window, Tel Aviv's Thursday night becoming Friday. The Shabbat siren would sound soon.

Send.
