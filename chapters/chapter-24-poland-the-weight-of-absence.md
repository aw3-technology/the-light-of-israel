# Chapter 24: Poland — The Weight of Absence

At Auschwitz, the birds sang, and that was the most obscene thing of all.

Ethan stood at the gate, December frost making the infamous words gleam: Arbeit macht frei—work makes free. The lie cast in iron, preserved like evidence, while sparrows chirped in nearby trees as if this were just another morning.

Tour groups gathered—schoolchildren solemn, Americans with cameras, Israelis wrapped in flags. A young Polish guide spoke in hushed tones as she counted. How did anyone smile here? How did birds sing? How did the sun shine on ground that had swallowed so much darkness?

He separated from his assigned group, needing to walk alone through this anti-Jerusalem, this place where presence became absence, where industry perfected extinction, where his grandmother's world had been processed into smoke.

The museum began with numbers. One million murdered here. Three million Polish Jews erased. Six million total. The numbers grew so large they became abstract—astronomy of annihilation.

Then the personal remnants. Suitcases with names painted in careful letters. Hair cut from the living. The belongings of people who had packed for a journey they would never complete.

One suitcase: R. Steinberg. His grandmother's maiden name.

*Not her—she'd already left for America. But her cousin maybe? Her aunt?* The accident of geography that made him witness instead of victim.

The second camp sprawled beyond sight, barracks extending to horizons. Tracks ran straight through the gate, ending at crematoria ruins the Nazis tried to erase.

Ethan walked the track's length, each tie a heartbeat, a name. Here was where selections happened—left meant immediate death, right meant temporary slavery. Children left. Elderly left. Mothers who wouldn’t release a hand, left. Efficiency sorting humans like mail.

Groups of visitors moved through in waves—some weeping, some silent, some snapping selfies. *What am I among them?* he wondered. *The descendant of people who left before the killing? A tourist of my own family's destruction?*


His grandmother's birth town lay three hours east, past fields that looked peaceful forever, past villages where church spires had watched Jews marched away.

The driver, arranged through the hotel, knew why tourists went to Brzeziny. "Nothing there," he said in broken English. "No Jews since war. You have family?"

"Had," Ethan corrected. *Do I have the right to claim them? Or am I just a disaster tourist with a Jewish last name?*

Brzeziny revealed itself slowly—outlying farms, then concrete blocks, finally an old town center where cobblestones remembered more than they could tell. No signs indicated Jewish history. No monuments marked absence. A town half‑Jewish for five hundred years and then, in one October day in 1942, wasn’t.

The church stood where the synagogue had been, its walls incorporating stones that still bore traces of Hebrew letters, palimpsest of erasure. The priest, when asked, knew nothing about Jews. "Before my time," he said, though the mezuzah marks on nearby doorframes suggested that forgetting was a choice, not chronology.

Ethan found him by accident, or perhaps by that divine choreography that had been guiding him since October. An old man sitting on a bench near what had been the market square, feeding pigeons with ritualistic precision—seven pieces of bread to each bird, counting in what sounded like Hebrew numbers.

"You're Jewish," Ethan said in English, then tried the Hebrew: "Atah Yehudi?"

The man looked up with eyes that held eighty years of solitude. "I am the last," he said. "Stanisław Rosen. What brings an American here? We don't get many tourists."

"My grandmother's family. The Steinbergs."

Stanisław's face changed, clouds shifting. "Steinberg..." He studied Ethan's features. "There were several Steinberg families. Which one?"

"Rivka. She left for America before..." 

"Rivka." His eyes brightened, then clouded with uncertainty. "Beautiful girl. Smart. Too smart, my mother said—girls shouldn't read so much. But Rivka..." He paused. "Or was that her sister Mindel? Sometimes the faces blur. Eighty years alone and you wonder if you're remembering people who existed or people you needed to exist."

Stanisław stood with difficulty. "Come. You came to see what isn’t here. I’ll show you where it was."

They walked through Brzeziny's phantom geography, Stanisław narrating invisibility: "Here, the kosher butcher. There, the cheder where we learned. Your grandmother sat there"—pointing to an empty lot—"in the women's section, third row, always third row because she said she could hear better but really because she could whisper to her friend Mindel."

Each absence had specificity. Not just "Jews lived here" but "Moshe the tailor who hummed Psalm 23 while hemming." Not just "synagogue" but "where Yankel fell asleep every Shabbos and snored through the rabbi's sermon."

At a small house on Długa Street, Stanisław stopped. "Your grandmother's house. The Kowalskis live there now. Good people. They maintain the garden she planted."

The house was modest, white‑washed, with windows that had watched everything and revealed nothing. In the garden, an apple tree heavy with December ice. "She planted it the year before she left," he said. "It still gives fruit. The Kowalskis bring me apples every autumn. They taste like memory."

"How did you survive?" Ethan asked.

"The Nowaks." He spat. "Good Christians who saved me and reminded me every day what it cost. Three years of bread and guilt. 'Remember, Stanisław, you owe us your life.' As if I could forget. As if they'd let me."

"Why did you stay?"

He opened his mouth, closed it. A long quiet. "You want the truth? I stayed because I was afraid. Afraid to leave the only place I knew, afraid I wouldn’t be special somewhere else. Here, I’m the last Jew of Brzeziny. Somewhere else, I’d be... nobody."

"One more place," Stanisław said, leading him to the forest edge. An unmarked clearing except for a small stone. Polish on one side: "Here lie 2,000 Jews of Brzeziny." Hebrew on the other: "May their memory be a blessing."

"October 28, 1942," he said. "I watched from the Nowaks' attic. The whole town marched past." He paused, swayed slightly. "I can't remember their faces anymore, but I remember the sound. Is that terrible?"

"Your grandmother's parents. Her brothers. All here." He gestured at the frozen ground. "I've said Kaddish here every Friday for sixty years. Today, you say it."

Ethan began the ancient words: "Yitgadal v'yitkadash sh'mei raba..."

When he finished, Stanisław was quiet for a long moment. "It was Rivka, wasn't it?" His voice was uncertain. "Sometimes I worry I've invented her. But you're here. So she was real."

At the clearing, as December light failed, he filled a small bag with earth. "Take them home," Stanisław said, pressing it into Ethan's hands. "They should know someone remembered. Their names were spoken."

*But should I take this?* Ethan thought, feeling the weight of the frozen earth. *What right do I have? I'm just a tourist with a Jewish name, collecting souvenirs of trauma.* Yet he couldn't refuse. The earth was heavy and cold through the bag.

"Will you stay here forever?" Ethan asked.

"Until I join them," he said. "Then no one will remember where the butcher shop was. No one will know that Mindel laughed like bells. No one will say Kaddish in the forest. But you came. That’s enough. Sometimes one witness is enough."

Security examined the bag of earth with suspicion. "What is this?"

"It's my family," Ethan said in Polish that came from nowhere, from the same place as the Hebrew, as the Kaddish, as the grief that had been waiting in him all along.

The guard, young enough to be his daughter, looked at his face, at his American passport, at the earth that could have concealed anything but clearly concealed everything.

"Rodzina," she said softly. Family. She sealed the bag, marked it with special tape. "No one will open this."

On the plane to Tel Aviv—the next stop in his journey through Jewish geography of exile and return—Ethan held the bag in his lap like the child he'd never have, like the past he'd never known, like the absence that would always be more present than any presence.

He texted Sera: "I found them. I found the absence of them."

She responded with just a heart emoji.

He understood. Some things have no words. Some absences are so complete they become their own presence. Some birds sing at Auschwitz because they don't know not to, and that ignorance is either the world's cruelty or its grace, and after walking through the geography of erasure, Ethan could no longer tell the difference.

Through the airplane window, Poland disappeared. In his lap, the earth of Brzeziny felt heavier than it should, though he wasn't sure if it was the weight of memory or just his own guilt. Had he been witness or tourist? The birds at Auschwitz sang because that's what birds do—they don't know the history of where they nest. Maybe he was like them, making sounds in places he didn't understand. Stanisław remained. The earth remained. Whether Ethan belonged to either was a question he would carry home unanswered.
