# Chapter 24: Poland — The Weight of Absence

At Auschwitz, Ethan's phone kept buzzing with work notifications, and somehow that felt more obscene than anything else.

He stood at the gate, December frost making the infamous words gleam: Arbeit macht frei. His mind went automatically to productivity metrics, optimization processes—the startup vocabulary he'd trained his brain to think in. *Work makes free.* The Nazis had run this like a business. KPIs for killing.

Tour groups gathered—schoolchildren solemn, Americans with cameras, Israelis wrapped in flags. A young Polish guide spoke in hushed tones as she counted. How did anyone smile here? How did birds sing? How did the sun shine on ground that had swallowed so much darkness?

He separated from his assigned group, needing to walk alone through this anti-Jerusalem.

The museum began with numbers. One million murdered here. Three million Polish Jews erased. Six million total. The numbers grew so large they became abstract—astronomy of annihilation.

Then the personal remnants. Suitcases organized by size like Amazon warehouse inventory. Ethan's eye caught the systematic arrangement—someone had curated this display for maximum emotional impact. *Even grief gets A/B tested.*

One suitcase: R. Steinberg. His grandmother's maiden name. He took a photo, then immediately felt sick about it.

*Not her—she'd already left for America. But her cousin maybe? Her aunt?* The accident of geography that made him witness instead of victim.

The second camp sprawled beyond sight, barracks extending to horizons. Tracks ran straight through the gate, ending at crematoria ruins the Nazis tried to erase.

Ethan walked the track's length, his sneakers crunching on gravel. *This is just infrastructure,* he thought. *Rails and ties and concrete platforms.* His mind tried to process it like a logistics problem—throughput, capacity, optimization. The startup brain protecting him from understanding what the rails had actually carried.

Groups of visitors moved through in waves—some weeping, some silent, some snapping selfies. *What am I among them?* he wondered. *The descendant of people who left before the killing? A tourist of my own family's destruction?*


His grandmother's birth town lay three hours east, past fields that looked peaceful forever, past villages where church spires had watched Jews marched away.

The driver, arranged through the hotel, knew why tourists went to Brzeziny. "Nothing there," he said in broken English. "No Jews since war. You have family?"

"Had," Ethan corrected. *Do I have the right to claim them? Or am I just a disaster tourist with a Jewish last name?*

Brzeziny revealed itself slowly—outlying farms, then concrete blocks, finally an old town center where cobblestones remembered more than they could tell. No signs indicated Jewish history. No monuments marked absence. A town half‑Jewish for five hundred years and then, in one October day in 1942, wasn’t.

The church stood where the synagogue had been, its walls incorporating stones that still bore traces of Hebrew letters. The priest, when asked, knew nothing about Jews. "Before my time," he said. But nearby doorframes still showed mezuzah marks.

Ethan found him by accident. An old man sitting on a bench near what had been the market square, feeding pigeons from a paper bag while muttering complaints at them in what sounded like Hebrew. "You, fat one, you had enough. Share with the skinny one. Oy, like Jews you fight over crumbs."

"You're Jewish," Ethan said in English, then tried the Hebrew: "Atah Yehudi?"

The man looked up with eyes that held eighty years of solitude. "I am the last," he said. "Stanisław Rosen. What brings an American here? We don't get many tourists."

"My grandmother's family. The Steinbergs."

Stanisław's face changed, clouds shifting. "Steinberg..." He studied Ethan's features. "There were several Steinberg families. Which one?"

"Rivka. She left for America before..." 

"Rivka." His face lit up, then frowned. "Ah, yes. Beautiful girl. Smart. Too smart, my mother said. But Rivka... wait, no." He shook his head irritably. "That was Mindel who was too smart. Rivka was the pretty one. Or maybe they were both pretty? Eighty years and faces blur together like watercolors in rain. Sometimes I think I'm making up half the people I remember." He laughed bitterly. "But I have to remember someone, or who will?"

Stanisław stood with difficulty. "Come. You came to see what isn’t here. I’ll show you where it was."

They walked through Brzeziny's streets, Stanisław pointing at buildings that weren't there. "Here, the kosher butcher. Terrible man, charged too much for chicken. There, the cheder where we learned." He stopped, looked confused. "Your grandmother sat... somewhere. Third row? Fourth? Memory is like a broken radio—sometimes it tunes in clear, sometimes just static."

"Moshe the tailor worked here—or was it Meyer? Both started with M. Anyway, one of them hummed while working. Psalm 23, I think. Maybe 42. Who remembers?" Stanisław waved his hand dismissively. "The synagogue was there. Yankel always fell asleep during services. Snored like a pig. The rabbi would glare but never said anything because Yankel gave money."

At a small house on Długa Street, Stanisław stopped. "Your grandmother's house. The Kowalskis live there now. Good people. They maintain the garden she planted."

The house was modest, white‑washed, with windows that had watched everything and revealed nothing. In the garden, an apple tree heavy with December ice. "She planted it the year before she left," he said. "It still gives fruit. The Kowalskis bring me apples every autumn. They taste like memory."

"How did you survive?" Ethan asked.

"The Nowaks." He spat, then immediately looked guilty. "Ach, I shouldn't say that. They saved me. Three years in their cellar, sharing their food when they barely had enough. But Mrs. Nowak..." He made a face. "Every morning: 'Stanisław, eat your breakfast. Remember what we risk for you.' Every evening: 'Stanisław, say your prayers to our Jesus who protects you.' Good people. Terrible people. Both at once." He shrugged. "Maybe that's everyone."

"Why did you stay?"

He opened his mouth, closed it. A long quiet. "You want the truth? I stayed because I was afraid. Afraid to leave the only place I knew, afraid I wouldn’t be special somewhere else. Here, I’m the last Jew of Brzeziny. Somewhere else, I’d be... nobody."

"One more place," Stanisław said, leading him to the forest edge. An unmarked clearing except for a small stone. Polish on one side: "Here lie 2,000 Jews of Brzeziny." Hebrew on the other: "May their memory be a blessing."

"October 28, 1942," he said. "I watched from the Nowaks' attic. The whole town marched past." He paused, swayed slightly. "I can't remember their faces anymore, but I remember the sound. Is that terrible?"

"Your grandmother's parents. Her brothers. All here." He gestured at the frozen ground. "I've said Kaddish here every Friday for sixty years. Today, you say it."

Ethan began the ancient words: "Yitgadal v'yitkadash sh'mei raba..."

When he finished, Stanisław was quiet for a long moment. "It was Rivka, wasn't it?" His voice was uncertain. "Sometimes I worry I've invented her. But you're here. So she was real."

At the clearing, as December light failed, he filled a small bag with earth. "Take them home," Stanisław said, pressing it into Ethan's hands. "They should know someone remembered. Their names were spoken."

*But should I take this?* Ethan thought, feeling the weight of the frozen earth. *What right do I have? I'm just a tourist with a Jewish name, collecting souvenirs of trauma.* Yet he couldn't refuse. The earth was heavy and cold through the bag.

"Will you stay here forever?" Ethan asked.

"Until I join them," he said. "Then no one will remember where the butcher shop was. No one will know that Mindel laughed like bells. No one will say Kaddish in the forest. But you came. That’s enough. Sometimes one witness is enough."

Security examined the bag of earth with suspicion. "What is this?"

"It's my family," Ethan said in Polish that came from nowhere, from the same place as the Hebrew, as the Kaddish, as the grief that had been waiting in him all along.

The guard, young enough to be his daughter, looked at his face, at his American passport, at the earth that could have concealed anything but clearly concealed everything.

"Rodzina," she said softly. Family. She sealed the bag, marked it with special tape. "No one will open this."

On the plane to Tel Aviv, Ethan held the bag of earth in his lap. Through the airplane window, Poland disappeared into clouds.

In his lap, the earth felt heavier than it should. Whether from memory or guilt, he couldn't tell.

His phone buzzed with work notifications. He turned it off.
