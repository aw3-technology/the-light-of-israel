# Chapter 24: Poland — The Weight of Absence

At Auschwitz, the birds sang, and that was the most obscene thing of all.

Ethan stood at the gate, December morning frost making the infamous words gleam: Arbeit macht frei. Work makes free. The lie cast in iron, preserved like evidence, while sparrows chirped in nearby trees as if this were just another place, just another morning, just another lie humans told themselves to make murder feel like policy.

Tour groups gathered around him—school children with solemn expressions, Americans with cameras, Israelis wrapped in flags. A young Polish guide spoke in hushed tones as she counted her group, her professionalism a thin barrier against the weight of this place. How did anyone smile here? How did birds sing? How did the sun have the audacity to shine on ground that had swallowed so much darkness?

He separated from his assigned group, needing to walk alone through this anti-Jerusalem, this place where presence became absence, where industry perfected extinction, where his grandmother's world had been processed into smoke.

The museum began with numbers. One million murdered here. Three million Polish Jews erased. Six million total. The numbers grew so large they became abstract, astronomy of annihilation, mathematics that the mind rejected like a body rejecting poison.

But then came the shoes. Forty thousand pairs, some so small they could only have belonged to children. Mountains of leather that had walked here believing in tomorrow.

*How do you process this?* Ethan stared at a tiny red shoe, still tied in a careful bow. *Someone's mother tied that bow. Smoothed that hair. Packed that suitcase.* The scale was incomprehensible, but the single red shoe—that was unbearable.

One suitcase stopped him cold: R. Steinberg. White letters on brown leather. His grandmother's maiden name.

*Not her,* he told himself. *She'd already left for America. But her cousin maybe? Her aunt?* The guilt hit him then—the accident of geography, the lottery of timing that made him the lucky branch of the family tree.

He found himself in a bathroom, collapsed against cold tile, his body rejecting not food but comprehension. Some things shouldn't be understood. Some things shouldn't be possible. Yet here was the evidence, methodical and preserved, the careful documentation of how a civilization dismantled itself by dismantling others.

The second camp sprawled beyond sight, barracks extending to horizons that seemed to curve with the weight of what had happened here. The railroad tracks ran straight through the gate, ending at ruins of crematoria that the Nazis had tried to destroy, as if even they knew that some evidence was too damning to leave standing.

Ethan walked the track's length, each railroad tie a heartbeat, a name, a world. Here was where the selections happened—left meant immediate death, right meant temporary slavery. Children always left. Elderly always left. Mothers who wouldn't let go of their children's hands, left. The arbitrary god of efficiency sorting humans like mail.

At the platform's end, Israeli teenagers had gathered, their voices rising in Hebrew song: "Ani ma'amin b'emunah shlemah"—I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah. Even though he delays, still I believe.

The song pulled something from Ethan's chest, words he didn't remember learning but somehow knew. He found himself singing, his voice joining theirs, this declaration of faith in the place faith died, this insistence on future in the place where futures were cremated.

"You're American?" one of the teenagers asked when the song ended.

"American," Ethan said, then stopped. *What am I? The descendant of people who left before the killing? The tourist of my own family's destruction?* "I don't know what I am anymore."

Kazimierz—Kraków's Jewish Quarter—had become what Europe did with Jewish absence: a theme park. "Jewish-style" restaurants, hipster cafes in former prayer houses. Of 65,000 Jews before the war, maybe 200 remained.

In the Old Synagogue museum, a guest book entry stopped him cold: "Looking for anyone who knew the Steinbergs from Brzeziny. I am the only one left."

Three months old. No contact. Another ghost seeking ghosts.

His grandmother's birth town lay three hours east of Kraków, past fields that looked like they'd been peaceful forever, past villages where church spires pointed toward a heaven that had been watching when the Jews were marched away.

The driver, arranged through the hotel, knew why tourists went to Brzeziny. "Nothing there," he said in broken English. "No Jews since war. You have family?"

"Had," Ethan corrected. *Do I have the right to claim them? To stand here and feel grief for people I never knew? Or am I just a disaster tourist with a Jewish last name?*

Brzeziny revealed itself slowly—first outlying farms, then concrete apartment blocks, finally an old town center where cobblestones remembered more than they could tell. No signs indicated Jewish history. No monuments marked absence. Just a Polish town that had been half-Jewish for five hundred years and then, in one October day in 1942, wasn't.

The church stood where the synagogue had been, its walls incorporating stones that still bore traces of Hebrew letters, palimpsest of erasure. The priest, when asked, knew nothing about Jews. "Before my time," he said, though the mezuzah marks on nearby doorframes suggested that forgetting was a choice, not chronology.

Ethan found him by accident, or perhaps by that divine choreography that had been guiding him since October. An old man sitting on a bench near what had been the market square, feeding pigeons with ritualistic precision—seven pieces of bread to each bird, counting in what sounded like Hebrew numbers.

"You're Jewish," Ethan said in English, then tried the Hebrew: "Atah Yehudi?"

The man looked up with eyes that held eighty years of solitude. "I am the last," he said in accented English. "Stanisław Rosen. And you—you have Rivka Steinberg's eyes."

The world tilted. "You knew my grandmother?"

"Knew her?" Stanisław's eyes brightened, then clouded. "Beautiful girl. Smart. Too smart, my mother said—girls shouldn't read so much. But Rivka..." He paused. "Or was that her sister Mindel? Sometimes I... the faces blur. Eighty years alone, you start to wonder if you're remembering people who existed or people you needed to exist."

Stanisław stood with difficulty, his body carrying more than its own weight. "Come. You came to see what isn't here. I'll show you where it was."

They walked through Brzeziny's phantom geography, Stanisław narrating invisibility: "Here, the kosher butcher. There, the cheder where we learned. Your grandmother sat there"—pointing to an empty lot—"in the women's section, third row, always third row because she said she could hear better but really because she could whisper to her friend Mindel."

Each absence had specificity. Not just "Jews lived here" but "Moshe the tailor who hummed Psalm 23 while hemming." Not just "synagogue" but "where Yankel fell asleep every Shabbos and snored through the rabbi's sermon."

At a small house on Długa Street, Stanisław stopped. "Your grandmother's house. The Kowalskis live there now. Good people. They maintain the garden she planted."

The house was modest, white-washed, with windows that had watched everything and revealed nothing. In the garden, an apple tree heavy with December ice. "She planted it the year before she left," Stanisław said. "It still gives fruit. The Kowalskis bring me apples every autumn. They taste like memory."

"How did you survive?" Ethan asked.

"The Nowaks." Stanisław spat. "Good Christians who saved me and reminded me every day what it cost them. Three years of bread and guilt. 'Remember, Stanisław, you owe us your life.' As if I could forget. As if they'd let me."

"Why did you stay?"

Stanisław opened his mouth, closed it. Stanisław was quiet for a long time. "You want the truth? I stayed because I was afraid. Afraid to leave the only place I knew, afraid I wouldn't be special somewhere else. Here, I'm the last Jew of Brzeziny. Somewhere else, I'd just be... nobody. An old Polish man with an accent."

The road to the forest was unpaved, unwanted, leading nowhere anyone wished to go. But Stanisław insisted, and Ethan followed, their feet crunching frozen leaves that had been falling on this ground for eighty Octobers since.

The clearing was unmarked except for a stone Stanisław had placed there himself in 1962, when he'd finally saved enough money. Simple Polish on one side: "Here lie 2,000 Jews of Brzeziny." Hebrew on the other: "May their memory be a blessing."

"October 28, 1942," Stanisław said. "I watched from the Nowaks' attic. The whole town marched past. Everyone. They made them dig. Then—" He stopped, swayed slightly. "I shouldn't have watched. A child shouldn't see... But I watched. All day. I can't remember their faces anymore, but I remember the sound. Is that terrible? That I remember the sound but not the faces?"

The trees around the clearing stood like witnesses, their silence so complete it seemed intentional. No birds here. No wind. Nature itself holding its breath.

"Your grandmother's parents. Her brothers. Her sister Mindel. All here." Stanisław gestured at the frozen ground. "I've said Kaddish here every Friday for sixty years. Today, you say it."

Ethan began the ancient words, the Aramaic emerging as if it had been waiting in his throat since birth: "Yitgadal v'yitkadash sh'mei raba..." Magnified and sanctified be the great Name...

The wind that hadn't been blowing stopped completely. The silence deepened beyond absence of sound into presence of listening. He spoke the names he knew—Steinberg, Rosen, Goldberg—and the prayer seemed to pull more names from the ground itself, from the trees, from the ice-heavy air.

When he finished, the December dusk was gathering, winter's early darkness settling over the forest like a shroud. The traditional three stars that marked day's end were just becoming visible, though nothing about this place obeyed natural law anymore.

"One more thing," Stanisław said, leading Ethan back through town to a building that looked abandoned, its windows boarded, its door hanging askew. Inside, beneath rotting floorboards, stone steps descended into darkness.

Stanisław produced a flashlight, its beam revealing carved stone, Hebrew letters, the architecture of sanctity preserved in secret. At the bottom, impossible but undeniable: water. Clear, still, reflecting their faces like memory.

"The mikvah," Stanisław said. "Ritual bath. Fed by springs. The Nazis filled it with concrete, but..." He shrugged. "Springs don't care about history. Water just... continues."

"It's been abandoned for eighty years," Ethan said. "How is there still water?"

"How is there still a Jew in Brzeziny? How are you here, grandson of Rivka who—" He paused, uncertain. "It was Rivka, wasn't it? Rivka Steinberg? Sometimes I worry I've invented her, that I've been alone so long I'm remembering people who never existed. But you're here. So she was real. Wasn't she?"

Ethan looked at the water, his reflection fractured by flashlight beam into multiple selves—the American who'd arrived, the Jew he was becoming, the grandson returning to say goodbye.

Without planning, without thought, he walked into the mikvah fully clothed. The water was warmer than it should have been, warmer than the frozen December day above could allow. He submerged completely, the ancient words coming unbidden: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with commandments and commanded us concerning immersion."

When he emerged, Stanisław was crying. "Sixty years since anyone... Sixty years..."

At the forest clearing, as December light failed, Stanisław filled a small bag with earth. "Take them home," he said, pressing it into Ethan's hands. "They should know someone remembered. They should know their names were spoken. They should know Rivka's grandson came back to say goodbye."

The earth was frozen, black with decomposition, heavy with presence of absence. It smelled like winter, like endings, like the particular silence that follows when everything that could be said has been said.

"Will you stay here forever?" Ethan asked.

"Until I join them," Stanisław replied. "Then no one will remember where the butcher shop was. No one will know that Mindel laughed like bells. No one will say Kaddish in the forest. But you came. Rivka's grandson came. That's enough. Sometimes one witness is enough."

Security examined the bag of earth with suspicion. "What is this?"

"It's my family," Ethan said in Polish that came from nowhere, from the same place as the Hebrew, as the Kaddish, as the tears that hadn't stopped since the mikvah.

The guard, young enough to be his daughter, looked at his face, at his American passport, at the earth that could have concealed anything but clearly concealed everything.

"Rodzina," she said softly. Family. She sealed the bag, marked it with special tape. "No one will open this."

On the plane to Tel Aviv—the next stop in his journey through Jewish geography of exile and return—Ethan held the bag in his lap like the child he'd never have, like the past he'd never known, like the absence that would always be more present than any presence.

He texted Sera: "I found them. I found the absence of them."

She responded with just a heart emoji.

He understood. Some things have no words. Some absences are so complete they become their own presence. Some birds sing at Auschwitz because they don't know not to, and that ignorance is either the world's cruelty or its grace, and after walking through the geography of erasure, Ethan could no longer tell the difference.

Through the airplane window, Poland disappeared. In his lap, the earth of Brzeziny weighed exactly as much as memory, as the accident that made him witness instead of victim. The birds at Auschwitz sang because that's what birds do. The water in the mikvah persisted. Stanisław remained. Memory resisted. Forgetting was death. And sometimes an American Jew stands in a Polish forest saying Aramaic words over unmarked graves, and for one moment the absence becomes presence, two thousand voices whisper: we were here, we mattered, we are remembered.
