# Chapter 3: Slack and Spirits

The Slack notification read "drinks tonight?" and Ethan responded with a thumbs-up emoji he didn't mean.

Wednesday afternoon in SoHo. Eighteenth floor, glass walls, someone's microwaved salmon lingering.

"So if we adjust the onboarding flow here," Naomi was saying, laser pointer dancing, "we should see a twelve percent increase in thirty-day retention."

Ethan nodded, made a note he wouldn't read. His phone buzzed—seventh time this hour.

"Ethan, what's your take on the friction points?"

He looked up. Eight faces waiting.

"The drop-off happens at payment selection. Users second-guess at the moment of commitment."

Everyone nodded. "Let's A/B test it."

Aaron in the group chat: "Broken Shaker at 7? They have that mezcal you pretended to like."

Ethan: "Can't wait to pretend again." Laughing emoji.

---

The subway to Williamsburg: delayed. Platform thick with brake dust. Seven unread messages—they were already there.

A busker played violin. Three notes up, five down. The same pattern, over and over.

---

The Broken Shaker. Exposed brick, Edison bulbs, aggressive cologne mixing with lime.

"Ethan!" Aaron stood for the brotherhood hug. "Three rounds in, you need to catch up."

Aaron Gold looked like success—tailored shirt, rimless glasses, maintained stubble. A thin gold chain caught the light at his throat, disappearing under his collar. Star of David, Ethan knew without seeing. Aaron's fingers found it whenever Palestine came up.

"Rough day?"

The bartender approached. Name tag: Gabriel.

"Every day's rough when you're defending people the system wants to disappear." Aaron's hand went to his collar.

Ethan ordered an Old Fashioned. Nineteen dollars for whiskey and sugar.

Sarah looked up from her phone, dark circles under her eyes. "Did you guys see the latest? Everything's getting worse."

"World's ending and we're drinking cocktails," Marcus said.

"My editor wants a piece on extinction anxiety."

A message from David glowed unread on Sarah's screen—six weeks now. "We're the most informed, least effective generation in history."

"Self-awareness isn't action," Marcus said, then caught himself. "Shit. I'm becoming my own rerun."

"Speaking of ineffective," Aaron said, "how was Rachel?"

"Fine. Nice. Nothing in common."

"Dark," Marcus said.

"Everything was fine," Ethan said, hearing how hollow it sounded.

A woman at the next table wore a Star of David necklace. Aaron's eyes caught it, slid away. His hand found his collar again.

"You need to get back out there," Sarah said, three unread messages from David on her screen.

"All dating apps are the same app."

"Capitalism ruins everything." Aaron raised his glass. They clinked.

The conversation drifted. Weekend plans. Aaron ordered another round—his fifth.

His phone lit with a name Ethan didn't recognize. Aaron stepped outside. Through the window, Ethan watched him on the sidewalk, one hand on his forehead, listening. After a minute, Aaron tapped into his phone: "I'll cover the car—just be there at nine. Text me when you're home safe."

When he came back, he didn't mention it. Asked if anyone wanted fries.

"Did you see about Jerusalem?" Marcus asked, scrolling.

Aaron's jaw tightened. "They're using Judaism as cover for—" He stopped, knuckles white.

"For what?"

"For destroying what it means." His voice cracked. "My grandmother didn't survive so we could—" He couldn't finish.

The table went silent. Aaron never mentioned his grandmother.

Ethan almost spoke. Almost said: *My grandmother too. Her stories, her candles.* The words formed, then died.

"Another round?" Gabriel appeared.

"Yes," Aaron said too quickly.

That made six.

Around them: startup pitches, bathroom crying, prosecco toasts.

"I'm so tired of living through historical events," Sarah said.

Everyone laughed because it wasn't funny.

Her phone buzzed. She looked down, face paling.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just—something about October seventh. Multiple sources—" She shook her head. "Never mind."

Behind the bar, something rectangular had been painted over repeatedly, the shape still showing through.

"I should head out."

"Already? One more round."

"Early meeting."

The check came to $64.10.

Outside, Aaron caught Ethan's arm. "Tomorrow. Coffee. Don't forget."

"I won't forget."

In the Uber, the driver had a Hebrew prayer hanging from his mirror.

Aaron texted separately: "Hey man, can we grab coffee tomorrow? Just us. Need to talk about something real."

The timestamp: 11:11 PM. His grandmother used to make wishes then.

Aaron never asked for "something real."

"Of course," Ethan texted back. "Name the place."

Three dots appeared, disappeared. Finally: "Franco's in Carroll Gardens. Bad coffee but the owner remembers everyone. 10 AM?"

"See you there."

Tomorrow was Thursday, October 5th. Two days before his grandmother's yahrzeit.

Back in his apartment, Ethan couldn't stop thinking about it: Aaron's white knuckles, the hidden chain, Sarah's unread messages, Marcus drowning in irony. All of them performing okayness while everything cracked.

Brooklyn night sounds filtered through his window. Somewhere, faint singing.

Tomorrow Aaron would tell him something real.

Tonight, Ethan carried the weight of almost speaking, almost connecting, almost choosing to be known.
