# Chapter 3: Slack and Spirits

The Slack notification read "drinks tonight?" and Ethan responded with a thumbs-up emoji he didn't mean.

Wednesday afternoon in SoHo. Eighteenth floor, glass walls, someone's microwaved salmon lingering.

"So if we adjust the onboarding flow here," Naomi was saying, laser pointer dancing, "we should see a twelve percent increase in thirty-day retention."

Ethan nodded, made a note he wouldn't read. His phone buzzed—seventh time this hour.

"Ethan, what's your take on the friction points?"

He looked up. Eight faces waiting.

"The drop-off happens at payment selection. Users second-guess at the moment of commitment."

Everyone nodded. "Let's A/B test it."

Aaron in the group chat: "Broken Shaker at 7? They have that mezcal you pretended to like."

Ethan: "Can't wait to pretend again." Laughing emoji.

---

The subway to Williamsburg: delayed. Platform thick with brake dust. Seven unread messages—they were already there.

A busker played violin. Three notes up, five down. The same pattern, over and over.

---

The Broken Shaker. Exposed brick, Edison bulbs, aggressive cologne mixing with lime.

"Ethan!" Aaron stood for the brotherhood hug. "Three rounds in, you need to catch up."

Aaron Gold looked like success—tailored shirt, rimless glasses, maintained stubble. A thin gold chain caught the light at his throat, disappearing under his collar. Star of David, Ethan knew without seeing. Aaron's fingers found it whenever Palestine came up.

"Rough day?"

The bartender approached.

"Every day's—" Aaron started, then caught himself. "People at the firm. Case got thrown out. Technicality." His hand went to his collar.

Ethan ordered an Old Fashioned.

Sarah looked up from her phone, dark circles under her eyes. "Did you guys see the latest? Everything's getting worse."

"World's ending and we're drinking cocktails," Marcus said. "Peak millennial behavior."

"My editor wants a piece on extinction anxiety," Sarah said, fingers drumming against her phone case. "Deadline's tomorrow and I haven't written a word. Can't figure out the angle when I'm living it."

"We know everything, do nothing," Marcus said, signaling for another drink. "At least we're consistent."

"Speaking of doing nothing," Aaron said, leaning forward, "how was Rachel?"

"Fine. Nice. Nothing in common."

"Dark," Marcus said.

"Everything was fine," Ethan said, hearing how hollow it sounded.

A woman at the next table wore a Star of David necklace. Aaron's eyes caught it, slid away. His hand found his collar again.

"You need to get back out there," Sarah said.

"All dating apps are the same—"

"Same app, different font," Marcus finished. "Capitalism ruins—"

"Everything," Aaron said, raising his glass. They clinked, a little off-rhythm.

The conversation drifted. Weekend plans. Aaron ordered another round—his fifth.

His phone lit with a name Ethan didn't recognize. Aaron stepped outside. Through the window, Ethan watched him on the sidewalk, one hand on his forehead, listening. After a minute, Aaron tapped into his phone: "I'll cover the car—just be there at nine. Text me when you're home safe."

When he came back, he didn't mention it. Asked if anyone wanted fries.

"Did you see about Jerusalem?" Marcus asked, scrolling.

Aaron's jaw tightened. "They're using—" He stopped, looked around the bar. "Forget it."

"Using what?"

"Judaism. As cover." His voice dropped. "My grandmother, she didn't... she didn't survive for this."

The table went quiet. Music kept playing. Someone laughed at the bar. Aaron never mentioned his grandmother.

Ethan leaned forward. "What did she—" He stopped, everyone looking at him. "I mean, what did she tell you? About surviving?"

Aaron stared at him, surprised by the question.

"She used to say..." Aaron's voice got quiet. "She used to say we survived for a reason. Not this reason." He gestured at nothing, everything.

Ethan nodded, throat tight. Almost said: *My grandmother too. Her stories, her candles.* The words formed, then died. He sat back.

"Another round?" The bartender appeared.

"Yes," Aaron said too quickly.

That made six.

Around them: startup pitches, bathroom crying, prosecco toasts.

"God, I'm just—I'm so tired," Sarah said, rubbing her eyes. "Every day there's another crisis to track, another deadline, another reason to panic. I can't keep up."

Marcus raised his glass. "Welcome to late-stage capitalism. Enjoy your stay."

Everyone laughed because it wasn't funny.

Her phone buzzed. She looked down, face paling.

"What?"

"Nothing. Breaking news alert. Overseas stuff." She shook her head, put the phone away.


"I should head out."

"Already? One more round."

"Early meeting."

The check came.

Outside, Aaron caught Ethan's arm. "Tomorrow. Coffee. Don't forget."

"I won't forget."

In the Uber, the driver hummed something under his breath.

Aaron texted separately: "Hey man, can we grab coffee tomorrow? Just us. Need to talk about something real."

The timestamp: 11:11 PM. His grandmother used to make wishes then.

Aaron never asked for "something real."

"Of course," Ethan texted back. "Name the place."

Three dots appeared, disappeared. Finally: "Franco's in Carroll Gardens. Bad coffee but the owner remembers everyone. 10 AM?"

"See you there."

Tomorrow was Thursday, October 5th. Two days before his grandmother's yahrzeit.

Back in his apartment, Ethan stared at Aaron's text.

"Need to talk about something real."

Aaron never asked for real. Aaron dealt in legal briefs and craft cocktails and carefully curated vulnerability. Aaron had made it through thirty-two years without needing anything from anyone.

Ethan typed and deleted three different responses. Finally sent: "Everything okay?"

Three dots appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again.

"Just need to tell someone who gets it."

But Ethan didn't get anything. That was the problem.
