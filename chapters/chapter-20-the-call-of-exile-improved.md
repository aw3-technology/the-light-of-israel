# Chapter 20: The Call of Exile

The dream came in Aramaic, and Ethan woke knowing he had to leave.

He sat up in Sera's bed, sweat-soaked. Through the window, Jerusalem's pre-dawn darkness. A siren wailed somewhere—ambulance or police, constant soundtrack since yesterday's stabbing. Beside him, Sera stirred but didn't wake, her breath steady despite the Glock in the nightstand.

The dream lingered: his grandmother, young, standing in ruins, pointing west. "They're watching," she'd said in words he understood but had never learned. "They know you're here."

Ethan slipped onto the balcony. November cold bit through his shirt. His phone: 5:41 AM.

"The visa expires in two weeks."

Sera stood in the doorway, wrapped in sheet, holding his passport.

"I know."

"Interior Ministry called yesterday. About your 'sudden religious awakening.'" Her voice caught. "They're suspicious. Americans who... change too quickly."

"We just found each other," Ethan said. "The Dead Sea, everything we've—"

"Some journeys you take alone." She moved beside him. "That's how you know they're yours."

The rabbi's study felt different. Maps covered his desk—Europe, Mediterranean, North Africa. Red pins like wounds.

"The Shabak called." Rabbi Levi didn't look up. "About you."

He pushed a folder across—Ethan at the Wall, at checkpoints, with Palestinian activists. Time stamps, locations, a file building itself.

"They're giving you a week." The rabbi's eyes were kind but firm. "After that..."

"But I just started—"

"That's why you have to leave. Voluntary exit or handcuffs."

Four cities. Athens, Rome, Berlin, Cairo. A Lithuanian couple's cancelled tour—their son called up for reserves.

"Three days," Rabbi Levi said. "Tell them you're touring heritage sites. Come back on a different visa when things calm down."

Am I a coward? The thought hit without warning. Running while she... while everyone here...

At the travel agency, the agent's hands trembled over the keyboard. Yellow tape covered the shop next door.

"This week?" He didn't look up. "My son got his Tzav 8 yesterday."

Emergency call-up.

The agent found tickets. "Cash only." His printer wheezed. "My grandfather walked these cities. Running. You'll fly them. Looking." A bitter smile. "Progress."

Sera was packing when he returned—her military duffle on the bed.

"Reserve duty. Twelve hours' notice. Gaza border."

"When?"

"Tomorrow night." She finally faced him, eyes red. "So you leave for your—for wherever you're going. I leave for... there."

The words came out wrong, broken. Not poetry. Just fear.

"One night," she said. "Before everything—"

She didn't finish.

That night they held each other like drowning people. She taught him the traveler's prayer, fingers tracing Hebrew on his chest. But also showed him shrapnel scars from 2014—inverted stars on her ribs.

"I might not have email. Or phone. For weeks."

"Sera—"

"Things happen here, Ethan. They always—" Her voice broke. "They always fucking happen."

His mother called the next morning.

"State Department warning. They're telling Americans to leave. What aren't you telling me?"

"I'm leaving tomorrow."

"Thank God. Come home."

"Athens first. Then Rome, Berlin—"

"Berlin? There were attacks last week!"

Ethan pressed his palm against his forehead. Everything felt wrong. Leaving felt like betrayal. Staying felt like lying. "She's being deployed, Mom. To Gaza."

Silence. Then: "Oh, sweetheart."

Rabbi Levi's study, final visit. Maps gone. One candle.

"Exile isn't punishment." Barely a whisper. "It's how sparks spread."

He pressed something into Ethan's hand—a travel mezuzah, worn smooth.

"Every doorway you pass through..."

Through the window, ambulance sirens. Then another.

"Go. Gather what we scattered."

The last night, they made Shabbat on Tuesday. She lit candles, he blessed wine. She gave him a Dead Sea stone, smooth and salt-dense.

"To remember—" she started, then stopped. "Just to remember."

"My unit," she said in the darkness. "Tunnel rats. That's what they call us."

The weight of it. Gaza tunnels. What finding them meant. What entering them meant.

She pressed an envelope into his hand, sealed. "Athens. If I—if something—"

"Promise me."

"I promise."

Outside, F-16 screaming overhead. They both knew what that meant.

Ben Gurion Airport, 4 AM. Sera drove in uniform, rifle in the back. Three checkpoints—double the usual. At the second, a soldier recognized her insignia, saluted.

"Stay safe down there, Lieutenant."

Lieutenant. She'd never mentioned rank.

At departures, she was trying not to cry and failing.

Security: three hours. They swabbed everything twice. The agent knew his file.

"Mr. Stone. West Bank. Twelve visits in six weeks."

"Research."

"Return date?"

"Forty days."

"New visa when you come back. Clean slate." Not advice—an order.

Behind the glass, Sera in uniform. She wasn't supposed to be here—had pulled rank. Their eyes met across the barrier.

She pressed her hand to glass. He matched it. She mouthed something in Hebrew—three words.

Then she broke. One tear, quickly wiped. She touched her rifle strap and was gone.

The plane lifted. Below, Israel became coast, became memory.

Ethan's hands shook as he reached for his pocket. The Dead Sea stone. Her envelope. The mezuzah. His phone buzzed—Rabbi Levi's text, but when he tried to read it, the words swam. 

He was leaving her to go into tunnels. Leaving while sirens wailed and mothers got phone calls and everyone who belonged here stayed to face whatever was coming.

The Mediterranean spread below. Jews had been crossing this sea for millennia, mostly fleeing.

This time felt different. 

But he couldn't name how.
