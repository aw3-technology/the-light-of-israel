# Chapter 7: The Day the World Broke

The notification.

10:47 AM.

Innocent as weather.

The moment before the vessels shattered.

Saturday morning, October 7th. Simchat Torah, though Ethan wouldn't realize the significance until later.

He'd woken hungover, head thick from Friday night drinks at another Williamsburg bar where everyone discussed optimization strategies for everything except meaning. Three alarms had failed to wake him. His mouth tasted metallic, like his body already knew what his mind hadn't registered.

Phone face-down on the nightstand. He'd managed three minutes before reaching for it, thumb scrolling before his eyes could focus.

Coffee first. The ritual: burr grinder, Ethiopian single origin, nineteen dollars a bag, ground to precise coarseness. But the smell was wrong—too bitter, acidic, like something burning that shouldn't be burning.

Like emergency.

Standing at his kitchen counter, scrolling through the usual—sourdough successes, marathon times, baby announcements. His brain automatically categorized each post: engagement bait, humble brag, genuine joy. The product manager's taxonomy applied to human connection.

The first headline hadn't registered.

Hamas.

Israel.

Attack.

Words floating past. Every other crisis. Every other somewhere-else catastrophe. Scroll past. Check Hinge. Check—

Then.

The videos.

Not polished. Not news. Raw. Phone recordings. Shaky. Vertical. Real.

The sound—

God, the sound through his phone's tiny speaker. Tinny but visceral. Sirens. Never heard them before but bones knew. Bones recognized. Wailing. Teeth aching. Screaming. Hebrew screaming. No translation needed. Human terror has one pitch. Universal.

Thumb slick. Sudden sweat. Slipping on screen.

Then—

Bodies.

Blood.

Black in pixelated footage.

A child's shoe.

Abandoned.

Dust.

The shoe was red.

Small.

So small.

Vision tunneling.

Each death another light going dark.

Coffee down. Set it down. Hand shaking. Why is hand—

Refresh.

"Hundreds dead."

Refresh.

"Massacre."

Refresh.

Numbers climbing. Odometer of loss. Every number a person. Every person a—

Cracking.

Something cracking.

Inside.

Ice over deep water.

Deep, dark water.

A video autoplayed: a young woman at a music festival, her last Instagram story. She was dancing, laughing, alive in the way only twenty-somethings at sunrise can be alive. The timestamp: 6:29 AM Israel time. The caption: "Perfect morning." The next video: the same field, smoke and running and sounds that shouldn't exist in the same universe as dancing.

Bathroom.

Made it.

Just in time.

Vomit. Sudden. Violent. Burning throat. Whiskey. Bile. Terror—does terror have a taste? Yes. This. This is what terror tastes like.

Tiles cold. Knees hitting floor. Collapse. Body rejecting—not just alcohol—something deeper. Something fundamental. Wrongness. Stomach knew before mind. Stomach always knows.


Gripping toilet rim. Porcelain. Cool. Real. Only real thing.

Shaking.

Whole body shaking.

Teeth chattering.

Can't stop.

Fluorescent light humming. Too bright. Too bright. Everything hyperreal. Everything too much.

Sound coming out. What sound? Never made this sound before. Sob? Scream? Both? Neither?

Primal.

Embarrassing.

Necessary.

Echoing off walls.

Coming back distorted.

Not his voice.

Can't be his voice.

His phone buzzed on the bathroom floor. Mom calling. He couldn't answer—not with his mouth tasting of bile, his hands shaking, this feeling like something was being torn out by the roots.

Back in the living room, daylight looked wrong—too normal while his phone showed hell in real-time. The neighbors played music. How could there be music? He couldn't stop scrolling, each video making him sicker, but stopping felt like abandonment.

Group chats exploding. Work Slack full of "This is horrible" with crying emojis. College WhatsApp fracturing into positions while the death count climbed. The phone grew hot in his hand.

Aaron's text: "Can't process this. Been reading all night. My hands won't stop shaking."

Another: "Found my grandmother's Holocaust photos this morning. Don't know why."

Ethan typed back: "Children are dead." Sent it before he could delete.

His chest felt crushed. He could feel the terror of every person in every video, their panic flooding his nervous system. He called his parents. The phone rang once—his mother had been waiting.

"Ethan? Oh thank God. Have you seen—"

"Mom." The word came out broken, childlike. "Mom, I can't—I don't—"

"I know, honey. I know."

But she didn't know. Neither did he. How could his body respond like this to deaths six thousand miles away? He'd never been to Israel. Had spent years carefully not caring. Yet here he was, hyperventilating on his couch, someone reaching into his chest and grabbing something vital he didn't know was there.

"Your grandmother's cousins... some of their families stayed. After the war."

Family he'd never known existed. Connections his parents had pruned in their careful assimilation, now flooding back.

"I have to go," he managed.

"Ethan—"

He hung up and immediately felt worse. His phone showed 613 unread messages across all platforms.

Twitter was chaos—everyone performing politics while bodies were still warm. Ethan found himself calculating: performative grief (67%), genuine shock (12%), politicization (21%). The percentages helped structure the chaos, even as he hated himself for reducing human response to metrics.

A video surfaced that broke through his last defense. A child, couldn't be more than five, calling "Ima! Ima!" through smoke and chaos. Ima—mommy in Hebrew, a word Ethan didn't know he knew until he heard it and felt it land like a stone in his chest. The child's voice pure terror, pure need, pure human suffering that predated politics and survived all analysis.

Ethan heard himself sobbing—ugly sobs from somewhere deeper than his own life. His mouth moved without permission: "Baruch Dayan HaEmet."

He stopped, shocked. Words ancient in his mouth, older than his forgetting. His grandmother's funeral—the rabbi had said this. But why now, alone, watching strangers die?

The sun was setting. He'd been pacing all day. Time had become elastic—hours felt like minutes, seconds of certain videos felt like forever. The apartment dark except for his phone's glow.

Aaron again: "Keep thinking about what my grandmother would say. She hid in Warsaw sewers for six months. Came out weighing 80 pounds."

Another text: "Is it wrong that I'm scared? Of everything that's coming?"

Finally, something real beneath the analysis.

His laptop sat open, cursor blinking in a search bar: "synagogues near me." He didn't remember typing it.

He closed the laptop.

Outside, Brooklyn continued its Saturday night. Through his window, people heading to dinner, to parties. Normal life while his phone showed children's bodies and his grandmother's language emerged uninvited.

His phone: voicemail from his mother. "I lit Grandma's menorah. I know it's not Chanukah, but I needed light."

7:18 PM. The number had appeared all day—timestamps, death tolls, flight numbers. This time he stared at it. Let it mean something.

The group chat: "Anyone want to grab a drink? I can't watch anymore alone." 

Ethan found himself at his window, looking out at Brooklyn. Somewhere out there were others feeling this same unexpected grief, this same confusion about why it hurt so much when it wasn't supposed to hurt at all.

His reflection in the window: puffy from crying, aged ten years in ten hours. His grandmother's features looking back—the genetics that had survived pogrom and migration, assimilation and forgetting.

He opened his laptop one more time. Congregation Beth Shalom. Vigil tomorrow night, October 8th. All welcome. Come as you are.

The words blurred with tears he didn't try to stop.

He walked to his dresser, pulled out the only dress shirt he owned. Laid it on the bed next to pants that might pass for respectful.

His phone: his mother answered immediately.

"Mom, I think I need to go to synagogue."

Silence. Then: "Your grandmother kept asking, near the end. If you ever went. If you remembered the prayers."

"I don't remember them. I don't remember anything."

"I don't either, honey. But maybe that's where you start."

After they hung up, Ethan sat in his dark apartment. The crack in his chest had widened enough to let something in—not light exactly, but the possibility of light.

Outside, October 7th was becoming October 8th. In this body that had surprised him with its capacity for ancient grief, something was ending and something else beginning.

Tomorrow, he might go to synagogue. The clothes were laid out. The decision hovered, fragile as first light.
