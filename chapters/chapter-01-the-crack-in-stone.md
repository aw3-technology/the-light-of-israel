# Chapter 1: The Crack in Stone

Ethan Stone woke to his phone alarm at 7:18 AM.

The time caught his eye—always 7:18, no matter when he set it. His backup alarm would go at 7:21, the third at 7:24. Three chances to rejoin the living.

He sat up, feet finding the cold floor. Tuesday. Or Wednesday. The days had stopped distinguishing themselves months ago, blurring into one endless loop of product launches and metrics reviews. His mouth tasted metallic—the flavor of dreamless sleep.

"Get up," he said aloud, his voice cracking from disuse. The sound startled him. When had he last spoken before noon?

His phone lit up: seventeen notifications.

Josh from engineering: "hey can you check the Mixpanel funnel?"
Maya from design: "v3 wireframes ready"
Calendar reminder: "9:30 standup"

No one calling his real name. Not the one his grandmother used to sing.

The coffee maker gurgled—Ethiopian single origin, nineteen dollars a bag. He poured a cup, black. The mug warmed his palms but the heat didn't penetrate deeper. Nothing did anymore.

He moved through his morning routine: shower (seventeen minutes), dress (tech-casual uniform), check phone (three more notifications). Each action automatic, performed by muscle memory while his mind floated somewhere above, observing but not participating.

In the bathroom mirror: dark circles, three-day stubble, eyes that had forgotten how to focus on anything beyond screens. He looked away.

His apartment: expensive minimalism masking emptiness. Everything in its precise place—keys on the third hook, shoes by frequency of use. On the bookshelf, barely visible behind design manuals, his grandmother's brass menorah. Seven branches tarnished green-black, waiting for light he'd forgotten how to kindle.

Upstairs, footsteps paced. The insomniac in 4B, every morning at three. Sometimes crying from 3C. Arguments from 5A. The building's collective insomnia pressing through the walls.

His phone buzzed. Three missed calls from "Mom." The fourth came while he was still in his bathrobe.

"Ethan? Finally."

"I'm fine, Mom. Getting ready for work."

"You sound tired." Something in her voice—not just worry but longing. "Your father thinks we should visit next month. We could go to that place in Brooklyn you liked as a kid, the one with the potato knishes Grandma would—"

"I'm busy with a product launch."

"Ethan." Her voice caught. "It's been almost a year since Grandma Rivka passed. October 7th—her yahrzeit is coming up. I found her recipe box yesterday. Her handwriting..." She paused. "I thought maybe we could light a candle together."

October 7th. One week away. He'd been avoiding the date, but dates didn't care about avoidance.

"I have to go. I'll call you tonight." The words came out too fast, meant to soften what they still hardened. He heard her intake of breath, the hurt he was causing, but couldn't stop himself.

He hung up and immediately regretted it. The phone sat silent, accusatory as any mirror.

The subway was packed. Bodies pressed close, everyone scrolling through headlines. An Orthodox family got on at 14th Street—father's tzitzit visible, children switching between Hebrew and English. One boy clutched a Hebrew primer, pages soft from use.

The sight caught in Ethan's chest. He'd had books like that once. His grandmother teaching him aleph-bet at her kitchen table, patient with his American tongue.

At Union Square, a homeless man pointed directly at Ethan through the window. "Israel!" he shouted as the train pulled away. "Wake up!"

Ali's corner bodega. Cardamom and newsprint. The elderly Yemeni owner counted change into his palm. "Seven dollars, eighteen cents."

Always $7.18. No matter what he bought. Ethan had stopped questioning it.

"Have blessed day, brother."

Ethan nodded, the blessing sliding off him like water off stone.

His work badge: "Ethan Stone, Senior Product Manager." No middle name. He'd dropped "Israel" in college. Too complicated to explain.

The office hummed on the eighteenth floor. Glass walls, new carpet smell, espresso machine hissing. At 9:30 standup:

"Drop-off at value realization. Ship the onboarding tweak, measure lift, iterate."

The words came out automatic, corporate poetry that meant nothing. Josh nodded. Maya took notes. The machine of optimization churned on.

His phone buzzed. Mother: "Your grandmother would be disappointed."

The text hit like a physical blow.

Rivka Stone. Her kitchen suddenly vivid—challah dough, chicken soup, Shabbat candles. "Close your eyes, shayna punim. Feel the warmth on your face. That's God saying hello."

She'd died last October 7th. With her went the last thread to something older than understanding.

Standing in his sterile office, Ethan felt something crack inside. Not breaking—cracking. Like ice before spring. The crack felt dangerous. Necessary.

By 6 PM, the office emptied. Ethan sat alone, laptop open to an empty compose window waiting like an unasked question. Outside, the sun set behind SoHo's glass canyon, casting shadows that made the city momentarily beautiful.

The elevator descended from eighteen like sinking through water, mirrors reflecting infinite identical tired men in identical expensive clothes.

On the street, evening air carried food truck smoke—halal chicken, cumin. He passed 541 West Broadway. The numbers caught his eye before he dismissed them.

The subway home. Brooklyn approaching through scratched windows. Somewhere in his apartment, in a closet he rarely opened, was a box of his grandmother's things. He'd never looked through it.

Maybe tonight.

The train pulled into his station just after seven. He noticed the time and almost laughed at himself for looking for patterns.

His phone buzzed as he reached street level. 7:19 PM. Unknown number:

*"The light you're looking for is closer than you think. Thursday evening. Congregation Beth Shalom, 7th Avenue. Ask for Rabbi Levi. Your grandmother spoke of you often."*

Ethan stared at the message. Nobody had this number who would know about his grandmother. Nobody knew he was looking for anything, least of all light.

But October 7th was coming. And Rivka Stone had always said that sometimes things lined up when you least expected.

He pocketed his phone and walked toward his apartment. The message felt like a door opening in a room he'd thought had no exits.

Thursday evening. Three days away.

His steps quickened.
