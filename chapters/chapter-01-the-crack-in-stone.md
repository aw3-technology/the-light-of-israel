# Chapter 1: The Crack in Stone

Ethan Stone woke to his phone alarm at 7:18 AM and wondered if this was what dying felt like—breathing out of habit, moving but not going anywhere. His surname had never felt more accurate: Stone. Heavy, immovable, sinking.

Seventeen notifications. No one calling his name. Josh from engineering: "hey can you check the Mixpanel funnel?" Maya from design: "v3 wireframes ready." A calendar reminder for the 9:30 standup where they'd discuss metrics that tallied clicks and mistook them for care.

The coffee maker had been programmed the night before—Ethiopian single origin, $19 a bag. He drank it because caffeine kept the machine running, even when the machine had forgotten what it was supposed to produce. The smell should have been rich, alive. Instead: a brown efficiency.

His apartment reflected his internal architecture: expensive minimalism masking emptiness. The Herman Miller chair adjusted to the exact same position every morning. The pristine kitchen island he never cooked on. On the bookshelf, barely visible behind design manuals, sat his grandmother's brass candlesticks, tarnished from a year of neglect.

He caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror and looked away. Stone eyes in a Stone face, carrying the weight of foundations that had forgotten what they were supposed to support.

The shower lasted exactly seventeen minutes. Steam rose like prayers he'd forgotten how to say. For a moment the water reminded him of his grandmother teaching him netilat yadayim, pouring water three times over each hand while whispering Hebrew that made the ordinary feel sacred.

His phone buzzed. Three missed calls from "Mom." The fourth came as he was drying his hair.

"Ethan? Finally."

"I'm fine, Mom. Getting ready for work."

"You sound tired." Something in her voice—not just worry but longing. "Your father thinks we should visit next month. We could go to that place in Brooklyn you liked as a kid, the one with the potato knishes Grandma would—"

"I'm busy with a product launch."

"Ethan." Her voice caught. "It's been almost a year since Grandma Rivka passed. October 7th—her yahrzeit is coming up. I found her recipe box yesterday. Her handwriting..." A pause, the sound of tears being swallowed. "I thought maybe we could light a candle together."

October 7th. The date hit him like cold water. Not September 30th as he'd misremembered. October 7th. One week away.

"I have to go. I'll call you tonight." The words came out too fast, meant to soften what they still hardened. He heard her intake of breath, the hurt he was causing, but couldn't stop himself.

He hung up and immediately regretted it. The phone sat silent, accusatory as any mirror.

The commute: subway car packed with morning commuters scrolling through another cycle of headlines about Gaza. An Orthodox family got on at 14th Street, children switching between Hebrew and English like Ethan once had with his grandmother. He felt nothing looking at them. Shouldn't he feel something?

At Union Square, a homeless man pointed directly at Ethan through the window. "Israel!" he shouted as the train pulled away. "Wake up!"

Ali's corner bodega. "Seven twenty," said the elderly Yemeni owner. Ethan handed over exact change. "Have blessed day, brother," the owner said. Ethan nodded without hearing the blessing.

His work badge read "Ethan Stone, Senior Product Manager." No middle name. He'd stopped using "Israel" in college, when the full name felt like carrying a flag for a country he'd never visited. Now just Ethan Stone—clean, professional, uncomplicated.

The office: twentieth floor, glass and steel overlooking other glass buildings full of other people optimizing other metrics. At the 9:30 standup he heard himself say, "Drop-off at value realization; ship the onboarding tweak, measure lift, iterate." Some part of his mind observed that he was speaking a language that had replaced actual human communication. His phone lit with his mother's text: "Your grandmother would be disappointed."

Rivka Stone. Suddenly he could smell her kitchen—challah dough under his small fingers as she taught him to braid, chicken soup with too much dill, the waxy scent of Shabbat candles she'd light every Friday, whispering prayers in two languages. "Close your eyes, shayna punim," she'd say. "Feel the warmth on your face. That's God saying hello." She'd died last October 7th, and with her went the last thread connecting him to something older than his understanding.

For a moment, standing in his sterile office, Ethan felt something crack inside. Not breaking—cracking. Like an egg before hatching, or ice when spring comes suddenly. The crack felt dangerous and necessary.

By 6 PM, the office emptied. Ethan sat alone, laptop open to an empty compose window waiting like an unasked question. Outside, the sun set behind SoHo's glass canyon, casting shadows that made the city momentarily beautiful.

The elevator descended like sinking through water, mirrors reflecting infinite identical tired men in identical expensive clothes.

On the street, evening air carried food trucks and exhaust and the faintest hint of autumn. He passed 547 West Broadway, the numbers catching his eye before he dismissed the strange familiarity—maybe a gallery his grandmother had once insisted on seeing.

The subway home. Brooklyn approaching through scratched windows. Somewhere in his apartment, in a closet he rarely opened, was a box of his grandmother's things. He'd never looked through it.

Maybe tonight.

The train pulled into his station at 7:19 PM. He noticed the time and almost laughed at himself for looking for patterns.

His phone buzzed as he reached street level. 7:19 PM. Unknown number:

*"The light you're looking for is closer than you think. Thursday evening. Congregation Beth Shalom, 7th Avenue. Ask for Rabbi Levi. Your grandmother spoke of you often."*

Ethan stared at the message. Nobody had this number who would know about his grandmother. Nobody knew he was looking for anything, least of all light. Levi—the name tugged at something; a High Holiday card from years ago, signed by a Beth Shalom rabbi, was still wedged in a kitchen drawer.

But October 7th was coming. And Rivka Stone had always said that sometimes things lined up when you least expected.

Ethan pocketed his phone and walked toward his apartment. The message felt like a door opening in a room he'd thought had no exits. Thursday evening. A stranger who'd known his grandmother.

His steps quickened, but uncertainty quickened too—hope threading through dread like light through cracks he couldn't yet see.
