# Chapter 1: The Crack in Stone

Ethan Stone woke to his phone alarm at 7:18 AM—his backup alarm set for 7:21, his third for 7:24, because oversleeping meant disappointing someone somewhere and disappointment was the one thing he could still prevent even if he couldn't prevent the hollow feeling that came with consciousness. He wondered, not for the first time, if this was what dying felt like—breathing out of habit but not from purpose, moving through space but not going anywhere, existing in that gray zone between sleep and consciousness where nothing mattered and everything hurt in ways he couldn't name or fix or escape, just an endless Tuesday morning that could have been any morning in the endless months of his thirty-third year. His life felt like an app stuck in an infinite loading screen—all the right components initialized, good infrastructure, but something in the core logic was corrupted, throwing silent errors he couldn't debug. The alarm sound scraped against his eardrums, tinny and mechanical, a digital scream he'd chosen specifically because he hated it, because hatred at least was feeling something. His mouth tasted like something had died there overnight—metallic, sour, the residue of dreamless sleep that never quite refreshed, never quite restored, just maintained the minimum viable consciousness required to repeat this ritual tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. His surname had never felt more accurate: Stone. Heavy, immovable, sinking into depths that had no bottom, only darker shades of the same colorless descent.

Seventeen notifications lighting up his screen like a slot machine that never paid out—he'd already mentally categorized them by urgency level before opening: three high-priority (Josh's message would be about the funnel), six medium (Maya's wireframes), eight low (team chat). Each ping another demand on attention he didn't have for things that didn't matter from people who didn't know him beyond his Slack handle. No one calling his name—his real name, the one his grandmother used to sing. Josh from engineering with his lowercase urgency: "hey can you check the Mixpanel funnel?" as if funnels and conversions and cohort retention meant something, as if optimizing user journeys could optimize the journey of a user who'd forgotten his destination. Maya from design: "v3 wireframes ready," another iteration of another feature for another product that would launch and die in the infinite cemetery of failed startups, each gravestone a landing page that converted nothing, not even hope into something more substantial than metrics. A calendar reminder for the 9:30 standup where they'd stand in a circle—though everyone would be sitting at their desks, cameras off—and discuss numbers that tallied clicks and mistook them for care, engagement metrics that measured everything except what it meant to be engaged with life itself.

The coffee maker had been programmed the night before—Ethiopian single origin, nineteen dollars a bag, fair trade and ethically sourced from farmers whose faces smiled from the package, their joy a rebuke to his joylessness—gurgling now through its cycle like a dying thing trying to remember how to breathe. The sound it made was the only heartbeat in the apartment, mechanical and predictable, counting down to its own obsolescence when the heating element would fail and he'd order another one with overnight shipping because waiting two days for coffee seemed like a catastrophe worth avoiding even though nothing catastrophic ever happened in his life, just the slow emergency of days becoming weeks becoming months becoming whatever this was. He drank it because caffeine kept the machine running, his machine, this biological apparatus that processed food into energy into emails into sleep into waking into this, even when the machine had forgotten what it was supposed to produce beyond consumption and excretion, input and output, the endless loop of existence without purpose. The smell should have been rich, alive—nutty, chocolatey, all the tasting notes promised on the artisanal bag by copywriters who probably drank instant—but instead it registered as mere brown efficiency, a hot liquid that performed the function of coffee without being coffee in any meaningful sense, like everything in his life that performed functions without meaning, like breathing recycled air in a climate-controlled environment that had eliminated weather along with wonder. The mug was warm against his palms but the heat didn't penetrate, stopped at skin level like everything stopped at skin level, never reaching the frozen core that might have been his soul if he believed in souls, which he didn't, couldn't, because believing required the kind of energy he'd allocated to scrolling through other people's lives on screens that grew warm with use while he grew cold with disuse.

His apartment reflected his internal architecture: expensive minimalism masking emptiness, a desert of chrome and glass where nothing grew, nothing lived, just surfaces reflecting surfaces in infinite regression of meaninglessness. Everything had its precise place—keys always hung on the third hook, shoes aligned by frequency of use, even the remote controls arranged by size—unconscious micro-organizing that gave the illusion of control. The air tasted stale, artificially fresh from the HVAC system that ran constantly, a mechanical breath that never quite cleared the staleness underneath, like trying to irrigate sand with recycled water. The Herman Miller chair adjusted to the exact same position every morning, its mesh back pressing into his spine in exactly the wrong places. The pristine kitchen island he never cooked on—smooth quartz cold under his fingertips when he steadied himself against it, its unmarked surface a rebuke to his grandmother's worn wooden cutting board with its geography of knife marks, each groove a meal prepared with intention. Upstairs, footsteps paced—the insomniac in 4B, three AM every morning, a metronomic reminder that others couldn't sleep either. He could feel the weight of their sleeplessness pressing down through the ceiling, their anxiety mixing with his own until he couldn't tell where his ended and theirs began. Sometimes he heard muffled crying from 3C, arguments from 5A that made his chest tighten with secondhand rage he had no right to feel. On the bookshelf, barely visible behind design manuals, sat his grandmother's brass menorah—not just candlesticks but the seven-branched candelabrum she'd brought from Poland, tarnished green-black from a year of neglect, each branch designed to hold light he no longer knew how to kindle, their waxy residue still clinging to the base like memory refusing to let go.

He caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror and looked away. Stone eyes in a Stone face, carrying the weight of foundations that had forgotten what they were supposed to support.

The shower lasted exactly seventeen minutes. Water drummed against his skull, too hot but he didn't adjust it—the slight burn was the only thing that cut through the numbness. Steam rose like prayers he'd forgotten how to say, fogging the mirror so he wouldn't have to see himself. The soap smelled like nothing—unscented, hypoallergenic, designed to leave no trace. For a moment the water running over his hands reminded him of his grandmother teaching him netilat yadayim, the ceramic washing cup smooth and cool, water shocking cold as she poured it three times over each hand while whispering Hebrew that made the ordinary feel sacred. Her kitchen had smelled of onions frying, always onions and schmaltz, life being rendered into flavor.

His phone buzzed against the marble countertop, the screen's spiderweb crack from last month's drop catching the bathroom light, fragmenting it into broken rainbows—shevirat hakelim, his grandmother would have said, the shattering of vessels, though he didn't know those words yet, only felt their truth in how everything in his life seemed to fragment the moment he tried to hold it. Three missed calls from "Mom." The fourth came as he was drying his hair.

"Ethan? Finally."

"I'm fine, Mom. Getting ready for work."

"You sound tired." Something in her voice—not just worry but longing. "Your father thinks we should visit next month. We could go to that place in Brooklyn you liked as a kid, the one with the potato knishes Grandma would—"

"I'm busy with a product launch."

"Ethan." Her voice caught. "It's been almost a year since Grandma Rivka passed. October 7th—her yahrzeit is coming up. I found her recipe box yesterday. Her handwriting..." A pause, the sound of tears being swallowed. "I thought maybe we could light a candle together."

October 7th. The date hit him like cold water. Not September 30th as he'd misremembered. October 7th. One week away.

"I have to go. I'll call you tonight." The words came out too fast, meant to soften what they still hardened. He heard her intake of breath, the hurt he was causing, but couldn't stop himself.

He hung up and immediately regretted it. The phone sat silent, accusatory as any mirror.

The commute: subway car packed with morning commuters scrolling through another cycle of headlines about Gaza. He unconsciously shifted his posture to mirror the tired slump of the woman next to him, his breathing syncing with the collective exhale as the train lurched forward—a hyper-empathic absorption he didn't even notice anymore, just another way his body betrayed him by feeling everything and nothing simultaneously. Body heat and coffee breath, someone's aggressive cologne failing to mask yesterday's sweat, the metallic screech of brakes that set his teeth on edge. The fluorescent lights flickered, casting everyone in a sickly greenish pallor. An Orthodox family got on at 14th Street, the father's tzitzit swishing against his legs, children switching between Hebrew and English like Ethan once had with his grandmother. One boy clutched a Hebrew primer, its pages soft from use. The sight should have triggered something—nostalgia, connection, anything. He felt nothing looking at them. Shouldn't he feel something? Even his numbness felt numb.

At Union Square, a homeless man pointed directly at Ethan through the window. "Israel!" he shouted as the train pulled away. "Wake up!"

Ali's corner bodega. The door chimed, a bright sound that hurt. Inside smelled of cardamom from the owner's morning tea, newspapers fresh with ink, the faint sweetness of overripe bananas by the register. "Seven twenty," said the elderly Yemeni owner, his fingers papery dry as they brushed Ethan's palm with the change. "Have blessed day, brother," the owner said, his accent wrapping around the words like a prayer shawl. Ethan nodded without hearing the blessing, the words sliding off him like water off stone.

His work badge read "Ethan Stone, Senior Product Manager." No middle name. He'd stopped using "Israel" in college, when the full name felt like carrying a flag for a country he'd never visited. Now just Ethan Stone—clean, professional, uncomplicated. Like every immigrant's child who'd simplified their name for easier pronunciation, every person who'd buried the parts of themselves that didn't fit the corporate template, every human who'd traded their full story for a comfortable lie.

The office: eighteenth floor, glass and steel overlooking other glass buildings full of other people optimizing other metrics. The elevator ride up made his ears pop, eighteen floors of pressure change. Inside, the office hummed—computers whirring, espresso machine hissing, the white noise of productivity. New carpet smell, chemical and sharp, trying to signal fresh starts. At the 9:30 standup he heard himself say, "Drop-off at value realization; ship the onboarding tweak, measure lift, iterate." His mind ran three tracks simultaneously: the words he was saying, what he should have said to make it clearer, and how Josh's micro-expression suggested confusion he'd have to clarify later in a carefully worded Slack message he'd rewrite four times. The words tasted like plastic in his mouth. Some part of his mind observed that he was speaking a language that had replaced actual human communication. His MacBook grew hot on his thighs, a constant low-grade fever. Someone's lunch—kale salad, lemon vinaigrette—made his empty stomach clench. His phone buzzed against the desk, a vibration he felt in his teeth. His mother's text: "Your grandmother would be disappointed."

Rivka Stone. Suddenly he could smell her kitchen—challah dough under his small fingers as she taught him to braid, chicken soup with too much dill, the waxy scent of Shabbat candles she'd light every Friday, whispering prayers in two languages. "Close your eyes, shayna punim," she'd say. "Feel the warmth on your face. That's God saying hello." She'd died last October 7th, and with her went the last thread connecting him to something older than his understanding.

For a moment, standing in his sterile office, Ethan felt something crack inside. Not breaking—cracking. Like the vessels that held too much light and shattered at creation's dawn, like an egg before hatching, or ice when spring comes suddenly. The crack felt dangerous and necessary, the first fissure in a vessel that had been containing the wrong kind of emptiness, the kind that weighs more than fullness ever could.

By 6 PM, the office emptied. Ethan sat alone, laptop open to an empty compose window waiting like an unasked question. Outside, the sun set behind SoHo's glass canyon, casting shadows that made the city momentarily beautiful.

The elevator descended from eighteen like sinking through water, mirrors reflecting infinite identical tired men in identical expensive clothes.

On the street, evening air carried food trucks—halal chicken, grease and cumin—mixing with exhaust and the faintest hint of autumn, leaves beginning to rot sweetly in hidden corners. His shoes clicked against pavement, a hollow sound. The city noise was a wall—sirens, honking, someone shouting into a phone about a delayed shipment. He passed 541 West Broadway, the numbers catching his eye—5+4+1=10, reduction to 1, unity, something his grandmother once said about numbers adding up to meanings—before he dismissed the strange familiarity—maybe a gallery his grandmother had once insisted on seeing, her hand papery in his, lavender perfume he could almost smell now if he tried, but trying hurt.

The subway home. Brooklyn approaching through scratched windows that turned the city into fragments, each scratch a crack in reality's mirror. Somewhere in his apartment, in a closet he rarely opened, was a box of his grandmother's things—her brass menorah wrapped in yellowed newsprint, prayer books with margins full of her penciled notes, a small ceramic pomegranate that used to sit on her windowsill catching light. He'd never looked through it, afraid of what broken vessels he might find, what light might still be trapped inside waiting for someone to gather the sparks.

Maybe tonight.

The train pulled into his station just after seven. He noticed the time and almost laughed at himself for looking for patterns.

His phone buzzed as he reached street level, the vibration traveling up his arm like an electric shock. 7:19 PM. The screen's blue light hurt his eyes in the growing dark. Unknown number:

*"The light you're looking for is closer than you think. Thursday evening. Congregation Beth Shalom, 7th Avenue. Ask for Rabbi Levi. Your grandmother spoke of you often."*

The words seemed to pulse on the screen, or maybe his vision was blurring from staring too long.

Ethan stared at the message. Nobody had this number who would know about his grandmother. Nobody knew he was looking for anything, least of all light. Levi—the name tugged at something; a High Holiday card from years ago, signed by a Beth Shalom rabbi, was still wedged in a kitchen drawer.

But October 7th was coming. And Rivka Stone had always said that sometimes things lined up when you least expected.

Ethan pocketed his phone and walked toward his apartment. The message felt like a door opening in a room he'd thought had no exits. Thursday evening. A stranger who'd known his grandmother.

His steps quickened, but uncertainty quickened too—hope threading through dread like light through cracks he couldn't yet see.
