# Chapter 14: Arrival in Tel Aviv

His passport trembled in his hands as the Israeli officer asked, "First time home?"

Ben Gurion Airport, November 15th, 2023, 5:41 AM. His American passport said "Stone, Ethan Israel" and the young woman behind bulletproof glass studied his middle name for a long moment.

"Purpose of visit?" Her English carried Hebrew underneath it, the accent that made questions sound like challenges, like tests, like the beginning of arguments that might become agreements if you wrestled long enough.

"I don't know."

Wrong answer for immigration. She looked up from his passport, studying his face like a map she'd seen before.

"Family?"

"Dead."

"Tourism?"

"Maybe."

"Business?"

"Finished with business."

She smiled—tired, knowing. Her stamp came down hard: November 15, 2023.

"Next."

But her hand lingered on his passport an extra second before sliding it back.

The arrivals hall erupted in Hebrew—a family reuniting with shrieks and kissing of both cheeks, three times, not the European two. A businessman arguing into his phone while his other hand gestured wildly, conducting an invisible orchestra. Two soldiers, M16s slung casual as backpacks, debating what sounded violent but was probably about falafel versus shawarma. The way everyone stood too close, talked too loud, touched too much—like New York if New York admitted it needed physical contact to survive.

"Taxi? You need taxi?"

Moshe—according to his license, photographed in 1987 when he still had his Moroccan curls, before the Lebanon War took his oldest son's hearing and his own hair. The Mercedes smelled like Noblesse cigarettes and pine air freshener fighting a losing battle against forty years of accumulated arguments, coffee spills, and the ghosts of ten thousand airport runs.

"Where to?"

"Tel Aviv. A hotel. Any hotel."

"Any hotel? What are you, rich? Specific hotel. I take you to my cousin's place, good price, close to beach. You look like you need beach."

They passed Lod, where palm trees grew next to Soviet-style apartment blocks. A Bedouin man sold watermelons from a truck marked in Arabic, Hebrew, and Russian. Construction cranes everywhere, building on top of Ottoman ruins on top of Crusader stones on top of Herodian walls—the archaeology of stubbornness.

"First time?" Moshe navigated traffic like warfare, like ballet, like the choreography of survival that required aggression and grace in equal measure.

"Yes."

"No. Nobody comes for first time now. After October 7th, only family comes. Only Jews. You're Jewish?"

"I'm discovering that."

"Discovering?" Moshe laughed, swerving around a Vespa carrying three people and a washing machine. "My grandmother from Casablanca, she used to say—'You can change your name, your nose, your country. But Friday night, the candles know who you are.' She lit them even in the transit camp, '51. Mud floors, but Shabbat is Shabbat."

The radio played news in Hebrew, the cadence urgent even without comprehension, October 7th mentioned in numbers Ethan recognized—sheva b'October—the date becoming international, translingual, the Esperanto of grief that required no translation, only recognition, only the nod that said yes, I know, we all know, we're all October 7th now.

"You have family here?"

"No. Maybe. Everyone's family now, right?"

Moshe adjusted his prayer beads hanging from the mirror—Muslim? Jewish? "My daughter, she's at the Nova festival site every Friday now. Setting up chairs. Lighting candles. Her friend Shani was there, October 7th. Twenty-two years old. Was." He merged aggressively into traffic. "So yes, everyone's family. Family price for you."

Tel Aviv materialized through morning haze—the white Bauhaus buildings of Rothschild Boulevard sun-bleached and salt-worn. A juice bar next to a synagogue next to a sex shop next to a hummus place that had been there since '48. Everyone on electric scooters, including a grandmother with her groceries balanced impossibly on the handlebars.

"The Cinema Hotel, Dizengoff 209," Moshe announced, pulling up to a building that still had its original 1960s sign in Hebrew and English. "My cousin Avi bought it from the Russians who bought it from the Romanians. Tell him Moshe from the Tuesday poker game sent you. Don't mention I owe him 800 shekels."

The hotel lobby contained decades of accumulation—Ottoman tiles, British Mandate furniture, a kibbutz-era mural of workers, a sign for WiFi in six languages.

"You came now?" The desk clerk—not Avi but someone younger, maybe twenty-five, maybe just back from army service, maybe still processing his own October 7th—handed over a key attached to a plastic palm tree, the kitsch somehow profound, the paradise promised despite everything. "After everything that happened, you came now?"

"Maybe because of everything that happened."

"Room 613."

The number stopped Ethan cold—613, the mitzvot, the commandments, the completeness of Jewish obligation compressed into a room number in a tired hotel in Tel Aviv where November felt like August, where the air conditioner rattled like prophecy, where his grandmother's dreams had apparently been assigned a specific location, fourth floor, facing the sea she'd never seen but always faced during prayer.

The room was everything and nothing—bed, desk, bathroom where the shower would later alternate between scalding and freezing like Israeli discourse, like the country's relationship with itself, with God, with the world that expected it to be other than what it was which was impossible, which was necessary, which was here.

But the window.

The Mediterranean stretched infinite and biblical, the same water Jonah had sailed, that Romans had crossed, that refugees had drowned in, that now caught morning light like promises, like threats, like the color blue God had invented before Creation because even Nothing needed something to contrast with, something to long for, something to prove that beauty existed independent of observers, independent of meaning, independent of October 7th and every October before and after.

Ethan opened the window and salt air entered like homecoming, like recognition, like his lungs had been waiting for this specific mixture of sea and exhaust, of antiquity and urgency, of sacred and profane that existed nowhere else, that made Tel Aviv Tel Aviv, that made Israel Israel, that made him—what? He didn't know yet. Couldn't know yet. Could only breathe it in and feel his cells reorganizing, his DNA remembering, his grandmother's prayers finally arriving at their intended destination, forty years late but arriving, which in Jewish time was exactly on time.

The beach was five minutes away but took thirty to reach—Ethan stopping at every Hebrew sign, trying to decode letters that looked like mathematics, like music notation, like the visual representation of wrestling itself, all angles and arguments, lines that refused to curve, curves that insisted on angularity, the alphabet of a people who'd learned to make everything difficult because easy had never been offered, never been possible, never been the point.

The sand at Frishman Beach already crowded at 7 AM—matkot players whacking balls with wooden paddles, the percussion of Israeli mornings. Russian women in swimming caps doing synchronized aqua aerobics. A group of Eritrean refugees teaching their kids to swim. The lifeguard tower covered in October 7th memorial stickers, but the lifeguard himself telling jokes, flirting, living.

He touched the water and it was warmer than the Atlantic in July, saltier than tears. The Mediterranean didn't care about his dress pants, his American anxiety, his grandmother's dreams. It just was—ancient and immediate, the same water that had carried Phoenician ships, Roman galleys, refugee boats from Europe, surfboards this morning.

"American?" A woman jogging past, sports bra and combat boots, the Israeli combination of fitness and readiness that made every citizen look like they were training for something, which they were, which they'd always been, which October 7th had reminded everyone they'd never stopped being.

"Is it that obvious?"

"The dress pants in the ocean, yes. Also the crying."

Was he crying? His face was wet but that could have been sea spray, sweat, the humidity that made Tel Aviv feel like breathing through gauze, through grief, through the thick air of a city that insisted on being Miami and Jerusalem simultaneously, refused to choose, refused to apologize, refused to be anything other than this impossible amalgamation of holy and hedonistic, ancient and instant, grieving and dancing, sometimes in the same body, the same moment, the same breath.

"You came for October 7th solidarity?"

"I came for—I don't know what I came for."

"Nobody knows why they come. But everyone knows when they arrive. You've arrived?"

"I'm arriving."

She jogged on toward Gordon Beach, where the drummers would gather at sunset like they did every Friday, the same rhythm since the 90s, the same circle that kept reforming no matter who left, who died, who October 7th had taken.

Breakfast at Café Bucke on Ibn Gabirol Street—plastic chairs, fluorescent lights, a photograph of the owner's grandmother from Thessaloniki. The menu in Hebrew, handwritten additions in Russian, the waitress switching between Arabic with the kitchen and English with tourists. An Ethiopian family at the next table eating injera with their shakshuka. Two Russian grandmothers arguing over newspapers. A table of tech workers, all on laptops, could have been in Williamsburg except for the M16 leaning against one chair.

"You're American." The waiter, twenty-something with army stories in his posture, unnecessary sunglasses, the affected casualness that came from having been very uncasual very recently.

"Yes."

"But Jewish American. After October 7th. So not really American anymore, right? Now you're ours."

Ours. The word hung between them like humidity.

The shakshuka came in a scratched skillet, bread still warm from the taboon oven, green olives from someone's uncle's farm near Ramla. Harissa on the side without asking—they could tell he needed it. The coffee came in a glass, Turkish style but served with milk foam like cappuccino, the Israeli inability to choose between traditions.

"How long you stay?" the waiter asked when Ethan paid, the bill handwritten, calculated in his head, the casual mathematics of a country where everyone could count, could calculate, could figure the angles necessary to make things work.

"I don't know."

"Nobody knows. Since October 7th, nobody makes plans past tomorrow. But tomorrow—tomorrow you should see Jaffa. Abu Hassan's hummus. Best in the country. Cash only. Closes when they run out."

The whale always finds you. Ethan walked back to his hotel carrying that phrase, feeling it settle into his bones beside all the other Israeli phrases that weren't quite right in English, that required Hebrew's directness, its elimination of unnecessary words, its compression of meaning into sounds that hit like hammers, like kisses, like the combination of both that was Israeli communication, every sentence a small conflict that might become connection if you stayed with it long enough.

His hotel room had been cleaned while he was gone—bed made with military corners, the Israeli attention to order that came from knowing how quickly disorder arrived, how fast things could fall apart, how necessary it was to maintain structure especially when, particularly when, specifically when the world was proving that structure was illusion, that safety was temporary, that October 7th could happen on any October 7th, in any year, to any Jews who'd forgotten they were Jews until the world reminded them.

He sat on his balcony as the sun began its descent toward the Mediterranean, toward Europe, toward America where it was still morning, where his mother had texted seventeen times, where Aaron was furious about him missing some meeting, where his life was continuing without him or at least pretending to, the automatic replies and out-of-office messages maintaining the fiction that he was temporarily unavailable when really he was permanently changed, permanently arriving, permanently in this moment on this balcony in Tel Aviv watching the sun set on his first day in Israel.

The muezzin's call began from Jaffa's Mahmoudiya Mosque, 5:47 PM exactly. Then the bells from St. Peter's Church. Then the Shabbat siren. All of them layered over the bass from a beach bar already starting its Thursday night party—the sacred and profane not wrestling but coexisting, exhausted from centuries of conflict into this strange truce of simultaneous sound.

Then the Shabbat siren, Tel Aviv's secular sacred announcement that time was shifting, that even the startup nation recognized sunset, recognized Sabbath, recognized that some rhythms preceded technology, preceded modernity, preceded the ability to pretend that time was uniform, that all moments were equal, that Friday night wasn't different even in a city that prided itself on difference, on being Israel's New York, Israel's Miami, Israel's everything-but-Jerusalem.

But Jerusalem was tomorrow. Tonight was Tel Aviv, was salt air through his hotel window, was Hebrew letters in his notebook, was the beginning.

His notebook, purchased at Steimatzky bookstore in the airport, already filled with Hebrew letters copied from signs. The barista at Aroma had laughed watching him trace the letters from their coffee cups—קפה הפוך—upside-down coffee, which somehow meant cappuccino.

The city lights flickered on—Dizengoff Street neon, Rothschild Boulevard cafes, the gay bars on Nahalat Binyamin already thumping. Teenagers heading to Barnoar. Adults to the wine bars on Ahad Ha'am. Everyone pretending Tuesday's rocket from Gaza hadn't happened, that the safe rooms weren't still stocked with water, that dancing wasn't also defiance.

But tonight, for the first time in his life, Ethan Israel Stone wasn't fleeing from the wrestling. Wasn't hiding his middle name. Wasn't pretending distance meant safety. Tonight he sat on a balcony in Tel Aviv, in room 613, the commandments surrounding him in number if not in practice, the Mediterranean holding light like memory, like promise, like the tomorrow that would definitely come because Jews had been practicing tomorrow for three thousand years, had made an art of tomorrow, had built an entire country on the premise that tomorrow was possible even when, especially when, particularly when today suggested otherwise.

Below, delivery guys on electric bikes ran red lights with the same disregard as Manhattan. Someone's grandmother watered geraniums on a brutalist balcony. A cat colony gathered around a woman with shopping bags full of chicken scraps. Thursday night shifting into Friday, the work week surrendering to whatever Shabbat meant in a city that couldn't decide if it was secular or sacred and had decided to be both, neither, everything.

Tomorrow, the waiter had said, he should visit Jaffa.

Tonight, he sat on his balcony watching the city refuse sleep, refuse silence, refuse anything but continuation.
