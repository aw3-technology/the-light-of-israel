# Chapter 4: 613 and the Space Between

His mother called three times before Ethan answered, and even then, he almost let it go to voicemail.

Thursday evening, October 5th, his apartment dark at 6:54 PM. The phone vibrated against the coffee table, each buzz a small earthquake of obligation.

First call: ignored while microwaving Thai food.
Second call: watched her photo light up the screen.
Third call: surrender.

"Hi, Mom."

"Finally! I was starting to worry. What if something happened? What if you were hurt? You know I can't help myself, I just picture the worst—"

Netflix frozen mid-episode, someone's face twisted in mid-expression. He left it paused and aligned the remote with the edge of the coffee table like precision could fix a conversation.

"Sorry, I was just—" The words caught. His mouth opened to say "drowning" but what came out was: "Working late."

"Always working, just like your father. Honey, you need to eat actual food, not whatever you're microwaving. David! DAVID! It's Ethan!"

Through the phone: dishwasher hum, news voices, ice against glass.

"How's Dad?"

"Golf, golf, golf. Spends more time with his nine-iron than with me. His back's acting up but does he listen when I say see a doctor? No." A pause, voice softening. "But enough about us—how are you, sweetheart? And don't say 'fine.' I can hear it in your voice when you're not fine."

The 'really' hung in the air like a door held open exactly three inches—enough to suggest entrance, not enough to actually enter.

"Working late, as always. You know me." His thumb worried at the battery cover on the remote until it creaked.

The lie came easier each time. On the muted TV, the subtitles scrolled: "[DRAMATIC PAUSE]" then "[SIGHS HEAVILY]."

"That girl you mentioned? Rachel?"

"It didn't work out."

"Already? You have to give people a chance."

"We had nothing in common."

"Your sister came with the kids for Rosh Hashanah. Henry's reading already—four years old."

Rebecca, who'd married Brad, whose kids had stockings at Christmas and chocolate eggs at Easter.

"That's great."

"Rabbi Goldberg asked about you. We barely had a minyan for Yom Kippur."

She said 'minyan' like it rhymed with 'onion.'

Static crackled on the line, the connection wavering.


"How's work?" His father's voice, clipped and measured—he'd picked up the extension in his study.

"It's fine, Dad. User optimization."

"Revenue projections on target?"

"I help people buy things they don't need more efficiently."

His father cleared his throat. "Job market's competitive. Benefits package solid?"

Silence filled the line—three people breathing in different rooms. The Netflix screen flickered, pixels rearranging.

"Oh! I almost forgot—tomorrow is your grandmother's yahrzeit."

She pronounced it 'yar-zite,' the way she said 'ballet' or 'croissant.'

"October 7th. Can you believe it's been a year already? Time just—" Her voice caught. "I should light a candle. That's what you do, right? I looked it up online but there were so many different—do you know? Please tell me you know."

"I don't know, Mom."

"She would have known. She always knew what to do."

Through the wall, music swelled. The sound made his chest tighten.

"Do you ever think about her?"

"Sometimes."

"She loved you. She said you had an old soul."

The smell hit him suddenly—challah rising, Friday afternoon sunlight through her kitchen window, her hands dusted with flour as she braided dough. The memory came with physical weight, pressing against his ribs like held breath. Those same hands had guided his small fingers over Hebrew letters in a book whose spine was held together with electrical tape.

"Don't be smart, Ethan Israel Stone."

"Sorry."

"Sorry. It's been a hard week. The news—Morocco, Libya, Israel. Always something with Israel."

"Maybe that's why they named me after it," Ethan said. "A problem that won't go away."

Silence. His father cleared his throat. "Your grandmother always said something about wrestling. Never made sense to me."

Through the wall, the music stopped abruptly, mid-phrase. His apartment suddenly felt enormous and tiny simultaneously.

"We have some of Grandma's things in the attic. Books, photos. That blue vase from Jerusalem. Your father found them looking for tax documents."

The vase. Cobalt blue with a crack down one side that his grandmother said made it more beautiful.

"Do you want them?"

"Maybe."

"We love you," his mother said quickly.

"Love you too."

"Come visit soon."

"I will."

"And Ethan? Maybe think about lighting a candle for Grandma."

"Okay, Mom."

"I ordered one from Amazon. Two-day shipping."

Of course she did. Two-day shipping for a memorial.

The call ended.

He unmuted Netflix. The episode resumed, subtitles scrolling in another language—Hebrew maybe, or Arabic, something with letters that curved and pointed. One word seemed to repeat, looked almost like "Teshuvah" but he wasn't sure. The letters shifted before he could focus on them. His thumb hovered over Google, then withdrew.

One browser tab was still open to High Holiday services in Brooklyn, buried under other tabs.

From somewhere in the building, that music again. Words this time: "Shema Yisrael."

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Amazon says delivery by noon tomorrow. Also found something in Dad's notes—Grandma's old address. 613 something street."

He stared at the number. 613. It meant something, he was sure of it. The knowledge sat just out of reach, like a word on the tip of his tongue.

He typed back: "What was the full address?"

Three dots appeared, disappeared. "Why? David, what was mother's address? He says 613 Riverside Drive. Apartment 4B. Why?"

Ethan deleted several responses before settling on: "Just curious."

He stood and walked to his window. Brooklyn spread out below, lights beginning to pierce the darkness. Tomorrow was Friday. Then Saturday, the yahrzeit.

The Thai food sat congealed on his coffee table, untouched after that first bite. Through the wall, the music started again, softer this time. His skin prickled, goosebumps rising along his forearms.

His mother had ordered a yahrzeit candle from Amazon. It would arrive too late.

Ethan opened his kitchen drawer, found the emergency candles from last winter's blackout. He pulled one out, held it up to the light. Found matches in the same drawer.

He struck a match. The flame caught, steady and warm. He held it over the candle's wick, watching wax begin to soften. His hand trembled—not from cold but from something else, some ancestral memory of lighting making its way through his arm.

The wick caught. For three seconds, the flame stood tall.

Then he blew it out. Hard. Like he was angry at the flame for existing.

But his hand was still cupped around the wick, protecting something that was no longer there. The gesture felt familiar, protective. Dangerous.

On screen, the man was walking somewhere, but Ethan had lost the thread of the story.

Ethan sat in his dark apartment, the only light from screens, the smell of sulfur fading.

In the attic in Westchester, in a box marked "Mom's Things," a blue vase with a crack down its side waited with her Hebrew books and photographs. And in his closet, wrapped in tissue paper, her candlesticks waited too.

The music through the wall whispered those words again—"Shema Yisrael."

Without thinking, Ethan's lips moved. Not quite forming the words, but trying their shape. His mouth remembering something his mind had forgotten.

Saturday was the yahrzeit.
