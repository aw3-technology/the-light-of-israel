# Chapter 4: 613 and the Space Between

His mother called three times before Ethan answered, and even then, he almost let it go to voicemail.

Thursday evening, October 5th, his apartment dark at 6:54 PM. The phone vibrated against the coffee table, each buzz a small earthquake of obligation.

First call: ignored while microwaving Thai food.
Second call: watched her photo light up the screen.
Third call: surrender.

"Hi, Mom."

"Finally! I was starting to worry. You know how I worry when you don't answer."

Netflix frozen mid-episode, someone's face twisted in what the subtitles called "[ANGUISHED EXPRESSION]." He left it paused and aligned the remote with the edge of the coffee table like precision could fix a conversation.

"Sorry, I was just—" The words caught. His mouth opened to say "drowning" but what came out was: "Working late."

"Always working. Your father's here. David, it's Ethan!"

Through the phone: dishwasher hum, news voices, ice against glass.

"How's Dad?"

"Golf three times this week. His back's acting up." A pause. "How are you, honey? Really?"

The 'really' hung in the air like a door held open exactly three inches—enough to suggest entrance, not enough to actually enter.

"Working late, as always. You know me." His thumb worried at the battery cover on the remote until it creaked.

The lie came easier each time. On the muted TV, the subtitles scrolled: "[DRAMATIC PAUSE]" then "[SIGHS HEAVILY]."

"That girl you mentioned? Rachel?"

"It didn't work out."

"Already? You have to give people a chance."

"We had nothing in common."

"Your sister came with the kids for Rosh Hashanah. Henry's reading already—four years old."

Rebecca, who'd married Brad, whose kids had stockings at Christmas and chocolate eggs at Easter.

"That's great."

"Rabbi Goldberg asked about you. We barely had a minyan for Yom Kippur."

She said 'minyan' like it rhymed with 'onion.'

Static crackled on the line, the connection wavering.


"How's work?" His father's voice suddenly in stereo, probably having picked up the extension in his study, the room where he managed other people's money with spreadsheets that measured everything except what mattered.

"It's fine, Dad. User optimization."

"I still don't understand what you do."

"I help people buy things they don't need more efficiently."

His father cleared his throat.

Silence filled the line—three people breathing in different rooms. The Netflix screen flickered, pixels rearranging.

"I almost forgot. Tomorrow is your grandmother's yahrzeit."

She pronounced it 'yar-zite.'

"October 7th. It's been a year."

Through the wall—music suddenly louder.

"I should light a candle," his mother continued, uncertainty creeping in. "That's what you do, right? Light a candle?"

"I don't know, Mom."

"She would have known."

Through the wall, music swelled. The sound made his chest tighten.

"Do you ever think about her?"

"Sometimes."

"She loved you. She said you had an old soul."

"Don't be smart, Ethan Israel Stone."

The lights flickered. On the screen, the frozen face shifted slightly.

"Sorry."

"Sorry. It's been a hard week. The news—Morocco, Libya, Israel. Always something with Israel."

Static surged on the line.

"Maybe that's why they named me after it," Ethan said. "A problem that won't go away."

"Your grandmother chose it," his father said suddenly. Another throat clear. "The Israel part. She insisted."

Silence. Then his father again: "Said something about wrestling. I never understood what she meant."

Through the wall, the music stopped abruptly, mid-phrase. His apartment suddenly felt enormous and tiny simultaneously.

"We have some of Grandma's things in the attic. Books, photos. That blue vase from Jerusalem. Your father found them looking for tax documents."

The vase. Cobalt blue with a crack down one side that his grandmother said made it more beautiful.

"Do you want them?"

"Maybe."

"We love you," his mother said quickly.

"Love you too."

"Come visit soon."

"I will."

"And Ethan? Maybe think about lighting a candle for Grandma."

"Okay, Mom."

"I ordered one from Amazon. Two-day shipping."

Of course she did. Two-day shipping for a memorial.

The call ended at 7:35 PM.

He unmuted Netflix. The episode resumed, but the subtitles had glitched—different characters now, almost familiar. One word appeared repeatedly: "Teshuvah." His thumb hovered over Google, then withdrew.

One browser tab was still open to High Holiday services in Brooklyn, buried under other tabs.

From somewhere in the building, that music again. Words this time: "Shema Yisrael."

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Forgot to mention—Grandma's apartment was 613."

He typed back without thinking: "613 commandments."

The response came immediately: "How did you know that?"

He stared at his own message. He hadn't known he knew it. The knowledge had surfaced from somewhere deep, unbidden. His fingers hovered over the keyboard, then typed: "Grandma must have told me."

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again. Finally: "She would be so happy you remembered."

He stood and walked to his window. Brooklyn spread out below, lights beginning to pierce the darkness. Tomorrow was Friday. Then Saturday, the yahrzeit.

The Thai food sat congealed on his coffee table, untouched after that first bite. Through the wall, the music started again, softer this time. His skin prickled, goosebumps rising along his forearms.

His mother had ordered a yahrzeit candle from Amazon. It would arrive too late.

Ethan opened his kitchen drawer, found the emergency candles from last winter's blackout. He pulled one out, held it up to the light. Found matches in the same drawer.

He struck a match. The flame caught, steady and warm. He held it over the candle's wick, watching wax begin to soften. His hand trembled—not from cold but from something else, some ancestral memory of lighting making its way through his arm.

The wick caught. For three seconds, the flame stood tall.

Then he blew it out.

But the smell of melted wax lingered, and his hand remembered the motion of lighting. A small victory of muscle memory over conscious resistance.

The Netflix subtitles still showed that strange word: "Teshuvah." The man on screen was walking somewhere.

Ethan sat in his dark apartment, the only light from screens, the smell of sulfur fading.

In the attic in Westchester, in a box marked "Mom's Things," a blue vase with a crack down its side waited with her Hebrew books and photographs.

The music through the wall whispered those words again—"Shema Yisrael."

Without thinking, Ethan's lips moved. Not quite forming the words, but trying their shape. His mouth remembering something his mind had forgotten.

Saturday was the yahrzeit.
