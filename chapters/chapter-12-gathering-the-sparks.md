# Chapter 12: Gathering the Sparks

The Zohar fell open to a page about hidden light, and Ethan felt his grandmother's presence in the room.

Rabbi Levi's study—walls of Hebrew texts, leather bindings cracking with age, menorah shadows dancing. Tonight the October darkness pressing against the windows held electricity.

"You asked why you feel broken." Rabbi Levi squinted at the text, his finger following right to left. "Shevirat HaKelim."

Ethan shifted. His mind wanted a problem statement, not mysticism. "Rabbi, I need something practical—"

"You design products, yes? First you create space. Remove features. Simplify the interface."

"Yes, but what does that have to do with—"

"Tzimtzum." The rabbi's arthritic fingers struggled with the heavy Zohar. "Divine contraction. God had to make room for creation."

Ethan helped separate the stuck pages, feeling their texture—rough, almost alive. A margin note in faded brown ink caught his eye: "The breaking is the beginning."

"So depression is... withdrawal?"

"Or making space for something new."

The rabbi drew a simple diagram—vessels, light, breaking. His hand trembled with age. "The vessels meant to contain divine light—they shattered."

"They weren't strong enough?"

"They were exactly as strong as needed. Breaking wasn't failure—"

"I don't—" Ethan stopped, swallowed. "How is this supposed to help? I can barely get out of bed some mornings, and you're talking about vessels?"

"Is it?" The rabbi's eyes sharpened. "Your grandmother understood broken vessels. Every survivor does."

Coffee stains marked the paper from previous lessons—real stains on real paper, not pristine PDFs. "I still don't see how this helps me feel less empty."

"Every late-night scroll through your phone—you're searching for something. But looking in the wrong place."

The rabbi stood with effort, knees cracking, and pulled down a book that shed leather flakes. "Rivka brought you here once."

"When?" But memory flickered—dark wood, her hand wrapped around his, powder and rosewater scent. Her Yiddish whisper: "Shayna punim, this is important."

"You were seven. She understood gathering sparks in darkness."

The rabbi opened to a marked page, binding cracking. "Try reading this."

Ethan struggled with the Hebrew. "Or... Or Ha..."

"Or HaGanuz. Hidden Light."

"In me?" Ethan laughed, bitter. "I eat bacon. I work on Saturdays. I haven't been to synagogue since my bar mitzvah."

"And yet you're here."

"Because I'm desperate. Not because I'm... divinely sparked or whatever."

"What's the difference?" Rabbi Levi studied his face. "Your depression—it's judgment without mercy. But breaking is the beginning of repair."

Ethan's throat tightened. "My grandmother used to say that. About breaking. I never understood." His voice cracked. "What if I'm too broken to repair?"

"Start with candles. See what happens."

Rabbi Levi wrote out Hebrew letters, slowly, painfully. His handwriting was barely legible. "Study this before sleep. Friday—light Shabbat candles."

"I don't know the prayers."

"So learn. Or don't. The light doesn't care about perfect pronunciation."

Walking home, Ethan felt different. Not fixed. Just... oriented. Like finding north after wandering lost.

In his apartment, behind old cables and dust: his grandmother's candlesticks. Tarnished green-black at the joints. One was dented—real damage on real brass.

He set them next to his coffee maker. Sacred beside mundane.

That night, studying Rabbi Levi's barely legible Hebrew, he guessed half the letters. The passage was about gathering sparks. Or maybe lifting fallen things. His Hebrew wasn't good enough to be sure.

He tried to light a practice candle. The match broke—cheap wood snapping between his fingers. The second match burned too fast, sulfur stinging his nostrils, heat biting his fingertips before he could drop it. The third lit but wouldn't catch—the wick was buried in wax from years of neglect, a tomb of accumulated Friday nights never observed.

He dug it out with a kitchen knife, waxy residue building under his fingernails, white flakes falling like snow on his dark counter. The knife scraped against brass—a sound that made him wince, too much like fingernails on chalkboard. Finally, he exposed a blackened thread of wick. The match trembled in his hand. Contact. A flame—tiny, fragile. It guttered, almost died, smoke curling up like a question mark—then steadied.

For a moment, watching that small light hold against the darkness, he thought about his grandmother. Not her death but her life. Friday nights when he was small, the way she'd cover her eyes and circle her hands three times over the flames, gathering the light toward her face. The Hebrew words he couldn't understand but felt in his bones. Had she felt this same uncertainty—this mixture of hope and foolishness? Or had faith come easier to someone who'd seen real darkness?

The flame flickered but held.

He texted Rabbi Levi: "I think I'm beginning to understand."

No response. The rabbi was probably asleep, or couldn't find his phone. Human limitations. Real world.

Friday was two days away. The candlesticks sat on his counter, patient as they'd been patient in the drawer, in his grandmother's cabinet before that, in her mother's home in Berlin before that. One still had old wax in it—layers of time, each Shabbat adding its own thin coat. How many Friday nights? How many women covering their eyes, whispering the same words?

He scraped out the residue, his fingernail blackening. Creating space for new light.

Maybe the sparks were everywhere. Maybe he was ready to start gathering them. Or maybe he'd just light candles badly and feel foolish.

The flame guttered one more time, then steadied. Waiting.
