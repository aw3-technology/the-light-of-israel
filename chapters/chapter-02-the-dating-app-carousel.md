# Chapter 2: The Dating App Carousel

Ethan had been swiping for forty-five minutes and couldn't remember a single face.

Left, left, left, right, left—Brooklyn dusk bleeding orange through his window while profiles blurred past. Yoga poses at sunset, startup founders at Machu Picchu, everyone declaring love for both adventures and lazy Sundays. Sarah had called him "emotionally absent" eight months ago. She was right, but knowing didn't make him any more present.

Rachel Klein would be his thirty-seventh first date since Sarah. Her message had cut through the noise: "Your bio says you optimize user journeys. Can you optimize this awkward opening message?" Direct. Funny enough. Wednesday evening date—low stakes, easy exit.

Ethan stood before his bathroom mirror, leaving the top button undone, rolling sleeves to mid-forearm. The dating uniform: dark jeans, navy button-down that Sarah had said brought out his eyes before she'd added "beautifully vacant." He'd chosen to hear only the first word.

His reflection looked competent and hollow. Somewhere in that face was Ethan Israel Stone, but tonight he'd be just Ethan—product manager, Brooklyn resident, the kind of Jewish that meant knowing about bagels and anxiety but nothing about why his grandmother had covered her eyes when lighting candles, whispering prayers that made their cramped apartment expand into something infinite.

The time read 7:18 PM. Three days until her yahrzeit. He hadn't lit a candle last year.

The Uber driver's name was Abraham. Of course it was.

"Going somewhere nice?" Abraham asked, accent carrying warmth from somewhere Ethan had never visited.

"Just meeting someone."

"Ah." Abraham's eyes found his in the mirror. "You'll find what you're looking for, my friend. Sometimes not where you expect."

The ride took 5 minutes and 41 seconds while Ethan studied Rachel's profile: marketing at a wellness startup, Northwestern, Columbia MBA, Fort Greene. In her photos she held wine glasses at gallery openings where the lighting was always golden hour.

The restaurant door opened to release three couples—finished with their attempts at connection. The hostess smiled. "Perfect timing. Table just opened up."

Rachel sat in the second booth from the back, looking exactly like her photos—both relief and disappointment. She stood: shoulder-length brown hair with expensive highlights, delicate gold jewelry, an outfit that looked effortless but wasn't. She had a nervous habit of touching a small scar above her left eyebrow, barely visible but constantly worried by her index finger.

Their embrace lasted two seconds. She smelled like bergamot and something sharp—ginger maybe.

"You made it through Brooklyn traffic."

"Not too bad." He noticed she'd chosen the seat facing the room, watching the door. The server appeared—tattooed sleeves, professional smile. "Can I start you with something?"

Rachel ordered orange wine before he'd opened the menu. "Trust me," she said, fingers on his wrist for exactly two seconds. "It's having a moment."

"So tell me about optimizing user journeys," she said, leaning forward. "Your profile made it sound almost interesting."

"I figure out why people abandon their shopping carts."

"The hero late capitalism deserves." Her laugh was surprisingly loud, unguarded. She covered her mouth, embarrassed. "Sorry, I snort when I actually laugh."

"Don't apologize. It's the first real thing I've heard all week."

She touched the scar above her eyebrow. "Real is dangerous on first dates."

The wine arrived—orange and cloudy, from the Golan Heights though neither recognized the significance. Rachel raised her glass. "To Wednesday night in Brooklyn."

"To Wednesday night in Brooklyn."

The wine tasted like apricot and dust. Around them, other couples performed identical rituals.

"Besides the thrilling world of abandoned carts," Rachel said, "what else?"

"The usual. Trying to read more, cook more. You?"

"Yoga teacher training I'll never start. Spanish on an app. Attempting to keep a fiddle-leaf fig alive. It's winning."

She had a habit of pulling her sleeves over her hands when she talked, like a teenager. It made her seem younger, less polished.

"So, Ethan—biblical name."

"My parents were going through a phase."

"My parents named me after my great-grandmother. She escaped Poland in '39, last boat out of Gdańsk." Rachel's fingers found the scar again. "Can you imagine? Twenty years old, everything you own in one suitcase, your entire family waving goodbye forever."

Something tightened in Ethan's chest. His grandmother had been twenty-two when she left Berlin.

"That's..." He should say something, share his own grandmother's story, create a real moment. Instead: "Heavy for a first date."

Rachel's face closed like a door. "Right. Sorry. Wine makes me weird."

"No, I didn't mean—"

"It's fine. Let's talk about Iceland. Have you been?"

They retreated to safer ground—her Northern Lights, his Tokyo confusion. The server brought small plates with precious names. Rachel photographed everything, posting immediately. The food was beautiful and tasted like nothing.

"What happened with your last relationship?" Rachel asked, cutting into burrata that bled white across the plate.

"We wanted different things."

"Translation: she wanted you to feel something."

The accuracy stung. "What about you?"

"He moved to San Francisco." She rolled her eyes, but something flickered beneath. "Said I was too much and not enough at the same time. Still figuring out that math."

Her phone lit up. She glanced, turned it over. His phone vibrated—his mother, ignored. 

"Want to know something?" Rachel said, wine softening her edges. "I've been on probably fifty first dates this year. They all blur together. Same conversations, same—" She gestured at the space between them.

"Same nothing?"

"Exactly. Like we're all auditioning for roles but nobody knows what the play is."

"Digital diaspora," he said without thinking.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just... wandering."

Rachel studied him, finger tracing the scar. "My grandmother used to say we were all in exile until we found our way home. Never knew what she meant." She laughed, bitter. "Probably meant Israel. She was always going on about Israel."

Ethan's grandmother had said the same thing. Had died saying it.

"Anyway." Rachel reached for her wine. "That's enough family trauma for one appetizer course."

The server brought dessert menus. They ordered another round instead.

"What time is it?" Rachel asked.

"Nine-eleven."

They kissed then, across the table—urgent but empty, pressing mouths against glass.

"This is nice," Rachel said, pulling back.

"It is."

The check arrived. Ethan reached for it automatically; Rachel did the wallet dance. Outside, September air carried hints of autumn and somewhere, distant singing—maybe from the Chabad house, maybe just Brooklyn ambient noise.

"I had a good time," Rachel said, because the script required it.

They kissed again—brief, competent, final. In the Uber to her place, 5 minutes and 41 seconds of careful space between them, her phone illuminating her face in bursts.

"This is me." A brownstone like every other. Another kiss, lighter than air. "Text me?"

"Definitely."

He wouldn't. She was already opening Hinge before her door closed.

Back in his apartment, Ethan opened the app again. Faces blurred past. His thumb moved automatically.

His phone buzzed. His mother: "Three days until Grandma's yahrzeit. Will you light a candle this year?"

His thumb stopped mid-swipe. Rachel's grandmother, last boat from Gdańsk. His grandmother, train from Berlin. Both women half a world away from everything they'd known, trying to plant something sacred in American soil.

He could text Rachel. Say his grandmother had a similar story. Create an actual connection from their careful performance.

Instead, he closed the blinds against the Chabad house singing, against the Brooklyn night, against everything except the glow of strangers' faces, each one a door to the same empty room.

But with his grandmother's yahrzeit approaching—October 13th, when he'd have to decide whether to light a candle, whether to remember, whether to remain Ethan or become Ethan Israel—he was beginning to remember that once, he had known what he was looking for.

Even if he'd forgotten how to find it.
