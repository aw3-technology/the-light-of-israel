# Chapter 2: The Dating App Carousel

Ethan had been swiping for forty-five minutes and couldn't remember a single face.

Left, left, left, right, left—Brooklyn dusk bleeding orange through his window while profiles blurred past. Yoga poses at sunset, startup founders at Machu Picchu, everyone declaring love for both adventures and lazy Sundays. Sarah had called him "emotionally absent" eight months ago. She was right, but knowing didn't make him any more present.

Rachel Klein would be his thirty-seventh first date since Sarah. Her message had cut through the noise: "Your bio says you optimize user journeys. Can you optimize this awkward opening message?" Direct. Funny enough. Wednesday evening date—low stakes, easy exit.

Before his bathroom mirror: dark jeans, navy button-down. Sarah had called it his dating uniform, said it brought out his eyes—"beautifully vacant."

His reflection looked competent and hollow. Somewhere in that face was Ethan Israel Stone, but tonight he'd be just Ethan—product manager, Brooklyn resident, the kind of Jewish that meant knowing about bagels and anxiety but nothing about why his grandmother had covered her eyes when lighting candles, whispering prayers that made their cramped apartment expand into something infinite.

Three days until her yahrzeit. He hadn't lit a candle last year.

The Uber driver's name was Abraham. Of course it was.

"Going somewhere nice?" Abraham asked, accent carrying warmth from somewhere Ethan had never visited.

"Just meeting someone."

"Ah." Abraham's eyes found his in the mirror. "You'll find what you're looking for, my friend. Sometimes not where you expect."

The ride took exactly the time it always took—long enough to study Rachel's profile, short enough to avoid real conversation. Marketing at a wellness startup, Northwestern, Columbia MBA, Fort Greene. In her photos she held wine glasses at gallery openings where the lighting was always golden hour.

Three couples exited as he arrived. Perfect timing.

Rachel sat in the second booth, exactly like her photos—both relief and disappointment. Expensive highlights catching restaurant light, delicate gold jewelry, studied effortlessness. A small scar above her left eyebrow that her fingers kept finding.

Brief embrace. Bergamot and something sharper—ginger root, maybe turmeric. The scent of someone who shopped at Whole Foods and read articles about adaptogens.

"You made it through Brooklyn traffic."

"Not too bad." She'd taken the seat facing out, watching the door like she was expecting someone better to walk in.

Rachel ordered orange wine before he'd opened the menu. "Trust me," she said, fingers grazing his wrist. "It's having a moment."

"So tell me about optimizing user journeys," she said, leaning forward. "Your profile made it sound almost interesting."

"I figure out why people abandon their shopping carts."

"The hero late capitalism deserves." Her laugh was surprisingly loud, unguarded. She covered her mouth, embarrassed. "Sorry, I snort when I actually laugh."

"Don't apologize. It's the first real thing I've heard all week."

"Real is dangerous on first dates."

The wine arrived—orange, cloudy, from the Golan Heights though neither knew the significance. They toasted Wednesday night in Brooklyn. The wine tasted like apricot and dust. Around them, identical rituals played out at other tables.

"So, Ethan—biblical name."

"My parents were going through a phase."

"My parents named me after my great-grandmother. She escaped Poland in '39, last boat out of Gdańsk." Rachel's fingers found the scar again. "Twenty years old, everything in one suitcase, your entire family waving goodbye forever."

Something tightened in Ethan's chest. His grandmother had been twenty-two when she left Berlin.

"That's..." He should say something, share his own grandmother's story, create a real moment. Instead: "Heavy for a first date."

Rachel's face closed like a door. "Right. Sorry. Wine makes me weird."

"No, I didn't mean—"

"It's fine." She reached for her phone, then stopped herself. "Tell me about your last relationship instead."

"We wanted different things."

"Translation: she wanted you to feel something."

The accuracy stung. "What about you?"

"He moved to San Francisco. Said I was too much and not enough simultaneously." She pulled her sleeves over her hands when she talked, suddenly younger. "Math I'm still trying to solve."

"Want to know something?" Rachel said, wine softening her edges. "I've been on probably fifty first dates this year. They all blur together. Same conversations, same—" She gestured at the space between them.

"Same nothing?"

"Exactly. Like we're all auditioning for roles but nobody knows what the play is."

"Digital diaspora," he said without thinking.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just... wandering."

Rachel studied him with new interest. "My grandmother used to say we were all in exile until we found our way home. Never knew what she meant." Bitter laugh. "Probably Israel."

Ethan's grandmother had said the same thing. Had died saying it. The words hung between them, heavy with possibility.

"Anyway." Rachel reached for her wine. "That's enough family trauma for one appetizer course."

They ordered another round instead of dessert. The conversation drifted through safe waters—work complaints, Netflix recommendations, the eternal New York question of neighborhood loyalty. Rachel photographed their food, posted immediately, the blue light of her phone reflecting in her wine glass.

"What time is it?" Rachel asked.

"Nine-fifteen."

They kissed then, across the table—urgent but empty, pressing mouths against the possibility of connection and finding only performance.

"This is nice," Rachel said, pulling back.

"It is."

The check arrived. Ethan reached for it automatically; Rachel did the wallet dance. Outside, September air carried hints of autumn and somewhere, distant singing—from the Chabad house down the block, or maybe just Brooklyn's ambient noise.

"I had a good time," Rachel said, because the script required it.

Another kiss—brief, final. The Uber ride back: careful space between them, her face lit by her phone screen as she checked messages, already back in the app.

"This is me." A brownstone like every other. Another kiss, lighter than air. "Text me?"

"Definitely."

He watched through her window as she disappeared upstairs, saw the blue glow of her phone screen, thumb already swiping. The same carousel they'd both just performed in person.

Back home, Ethan's thumb hovered over his phone. He could text Rachel now. Tell her about Berlin, about his grandmother's train, about candles and forgetting. The message started itself: "Your grandmother and mine..." but he deleted it before the second word.

His mother had texted: "Three days until Grandma's yahrzeit. Will you light a candle this year?"

Rachel's grandmother, last boat from Gdańsk. His grandmother, train from Berlin. Both women carrying prayers their grandchildren wouldn't understand, planting themselves in American soil with nothing but hope and terror.

He opened the dating app. The same faces from this morning, rearranged. His thumb moved automatically—left, left, right, left. Each face a door to the same empty room.

But somewhere between swipes, he stopped. Listened to the Chabad house singing drifting through his window. Felt the weight of three days, the unlit candle waiting in his drawer, the conversation he'd walked away from.

October 13th. The yahrzeit his grandmother had observed for her parents, that his parents had observed for her, that waited now for him.

Tomorrow he'd swipe again. Tonight, he sat in the space between forgetting and remembering, between the person he'd pretended to be and the person he'd never learned to become.
