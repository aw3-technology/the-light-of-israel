# Chapter 2: The Dating App Carousel

Ethan had been swiping for forty-five minutes and couldn't remember a single face.

Left, left, left, right, left. The rhythm had become automatic, thumb moving across glass while Brooklyn dusk settled outside his window. Each profile blurred into the next—yoga instructors and startup founders, Brooklyn Museum selfies and Machu Picchu sunsets, declarations of loving both adventures and lazy Sundays. He'd matched with dozens this week alone. Their messages sat unread in his phone like small debts he'd never repay.

Rachel Klein would be his thirty-seventh first date since Sarah ended things eight months ago. Not that he was counting. Her profile had stood out only because she'd messaged first: "Your bio says you optimize user journeys. Can you optimize this awkward opening message?" Clever enough. Safe enough. The kind of humor that passed for personality on apps designed to compress human complexity into six photos and three prompts.

Ethan stood before his bathroom mirror, running fingers through hair that cost forty-eight dollars to cut but still looked accidentally disheveled. The dating uniform hung ready: dark jeans that suggested casual success, navy button-down that brought out eyes he'd been told were his best feature, though he couldn't remember who'd said it or when he'd stopped believing compliments. Everything calculated to seem uncalculated.

His reflection looked back, competent and empty. Somewhere in that face was Ethan Israel Stone, but tonight, like every Friday night for months, he'd be just Ethan—successful product manager, Brooklyn resident, cultural but not religious. The kind of Jewish that meant knowing about bagels and anxiety but nothing about why his grandmother had covered her eyes when lighting candles, whispering prayers in a language that had once made their apartment feel larger than its four rooms.

The Uber driver's name was Abraham. Of course it was.

"Going somewhere nice?" Abraham asked, pulling away from Ethan's building. His accent carried warmth Ethan couldn't place—Middle Eastern, maybe North African.

"Just meeting someone."

"Ah." Abraham's eyes found Ethan's in the rearview mirror. "You'll find what you're looking for, my friend. Sometimes not where you expect."

Ethan stared at his phone, refreshing Rachel's profile like studying for a test. Marketing manager at a wellness startup called Breathe. Northwestern undergraduate, Columbia MBA. Lived in Fort Greene. Listed "Culturally Jewish" under religion. Photos showed her at gallery openings, hiking somewhere that looked like Big Sur, laughing at a dinner table surrounded by friends who all looked successful in the same indefinable way.

Terroir sat on a Park Slope corner, its Edison bulbs and exposed brick declaring its membership in the confederation of Brooklyn spaces that looked different but felt identical. Through the window, Ethan counted three other couples on what were obviously first dates—the posture too straight, laughter too quick, phones face-down in performed presence.

The address number caught his eye as he reached for the door: 613. Something about it seemed significant, but the thought dissolved as he stepped inside.

Rachel was already there, second booth from the back, and she looked exactly like her photos, which somehow felt like both a relief and a disappointment. Shoulder-length brown hair with expensive highlights. Delicate gold jewelry that suggested taste without trying. She stood as he approached, that awkward dance of hug or handshake settling on a brief embrace that smelled of something French and understated.

"Ethan! You made it through Friday traffic."

"Brooklyn to Brooklyn, not too bad." He slid into the booth, noting how she'd chosen the seat facing the room. Strategic or coincidental? Everything on dates became evidence to analyze later.

The server appeared—tattooed, perfectly friendly, probably an artist or musician serving wine to pay rent on a studio where she created things that mattered to her. "Can I start you with something to drink? We have some beautiful natural wines tonight."

Rachel ordered orange wine before Ethan could fully parse the menu. "Trust me," she said, touching his wrist lightly. "It's having a moment."

The touch was calculated but not unpleasant. Everything was calculated. Ethan ordered the same, wondering when he'd become someone who accepted recommendations about things having moments.

"So," Rachel began, the universal first-date opening, "tell me about optimizing user journeys. Your profile made it sound less boring than it probably is."

He laughed, the practiced laugh of someone who'd answered this question thirty-six times before. "It's exactly as boring as it sounds. I basically figure out why people abandon their shopping carts and try to make them abandon them less."

"The hero capitalism needs."

"That's me. Fighting the good fight against friction in checkout flows."

She smiled, the kind of smile that involved the right amount of teeth. "I'm basically the same but for wellness. Trying to convince people that a meditation app will solve problems created by having too many apps."

"How's that working out?"

"We just closed Series B funding, so apparently cognitive dissonance sells."

The wine arrived, orange and cloudy in glasses that cost more than the liquid they held. Rachel raised hers. "To Friday night in Brooklyn."

"To Friday night in Brooklyn."

The wine tasted like disappointment with hints of apricot. Around them, other couples performed similar rituals—the lean-in of feigned interest, the appreciative sip, the laugh that suggested depth without revealing any.

"So what else?" Rachel asked. "Besides optimizing capitalism?"

The question was an invitation to perform his personality. Ethan had a roster of anecdotes for this moment—the half-marathon he'd trained for but never run, the sourdough starter that died during the pandemic, the trip to Thailand where he'd found himself at a meditation retreat accidentally. All true, all meaningless, all designed to suggest depth without requiring any.

"The usual Brooklyn clichés," he said instead. "Trying to read more, cook more, generally be more of an adult. You?"

"Same constellation of aspirations." She twisted the stem of her wine glass between manicured fingers. "Yoga teacher training that I'll definitely start next year. Learning Spanish on an app. Attempting to keep plants alive with mixed success."

"The Brooklyn trifecta."

"We're all living the same life in different apartments."

The observation hung between them, too honest for a first date. Rachel covered quickly: "Though I did just get back from Iceland. Have you been?"

And they were back on script. Iceland led to travel stories—her Northern Lights, his Tokyo subway confusion. Each anecdote polished from retelling, deployed to suggest adventurousness without actual risk. The server returned. They ordered small plates with names that required explanation—burrata with something preserved, vegetables prepared in ways that justified their prices.

"So, Ethan," Rachel said as their second round of wine arrived, this one natural and red and tasting of earth Ethan had never walked on. "That's an interesting name. Biblical, right?"

"My parents were going through a thing." The dodge came automatically. Ethan Israel Stone becomes just Ethan, the middle name buried like something shameful. "You know how it is."

"Oh, totally. My parents named me Rachel after my great-grandmother who I never met. Very Jewish of them, considering we had a Christmas tree every year."

She laughed. He was supposed to laugh too. He managed something that sounded like laughter.

"Are you... I mean, your last name's Klein, so..."

"Jewish? Yeah, technically. Like, ethnically or whatever. But not, you know, Jewish Jewish." She gestured with her wine glass, encompassing some vast distance between Jewish and Jewish Jewish. "We did Passover sometimes. My dad would read from this children's Haggadah he got somewhere. Twenty minutes max, then dinner. You?"

"Same." The lie came easily. It wasn't even really a lie. His family's Judaism had faded to something similar—High Holidays sometimes, bagels always, Israel never discussed, Hebrew forgotten. "Cultural but not religious."

"The best kind," Rachel said, and something in Ethan's chest tightened.

The food arrived, beautiful and underseasoned. They photographed it without discussing why. Rachel posted to her story immediately. Ethan left his photos in his camera roll, evidence of a life he wasn't actually living.

"So what happened with your last relationship?" Rachel asked, cutting into burrata that bled white across the plate. "If you don't mind me asking."

The question was inevitable, part of the first-date choreography. Ethan had his answer prepared—mutual decision, different life paths, remain friends. All technically true. He never mentioned that Sarah had said he was "emotionally absent," that she'd accused him of going through life like a ghost, present but not really there.

"We wanted different things," he said. "What about you?"

"He moved to San Francisco for a startup." Rachel rolled her eyes. "Because apparently New York doesn't have enough of those."

They both laughed, conspirators against ex-boyfriends who chose California. The conversation drifted to safer ground—Brooklyn neighborhoods, streaming shows, the couple at the next table who were definitely breaking up. Twice Rachel's phone lit up. Twice she apologized and flipped it over. Ethan's phone vibrated in his pocket. He didn't check.

"Want to know something weird?" Rachel said, wine making her edges softer. "I've been on probably fifty first dates this year."

"That's not weird. That's just dating now."

"No, the weird part is I can barely remember any of them. Like, they happened, I was there, but they all blur together. Same bars, same conversations, same..." She gestured vaguely at the space between them.

Ethan felt something crack, just slightly, in the performance. "Same what?"

"Same nothing. Pleasant nothing. Like we're all auditioning for roles in each other's lives but nobody knows what the play is about."

The honesty lasted three seconds before Rachel laughed, bright and false. "Sorry, wine makes me philosophical. I promise I'm usually more fun."

"No, I get it." And he did, but getting it and doing something about it were different things. "It's like we're all browsing for connection the same way we browse for everything else."

"Exactly! Swipe, click, consume, repeat."

They were circling something real, but neither knew how to land there. The server appeared with dessert menus. Rachel demurred—"I'm trying to be good." Ethan agreed—"Same." They ordered another round instead.

The wine made everything softer but not clearer. Rachel told a story about her boss that required extensive context. Ethan responded with his own workplace absurdity. They were matching each other's energy, calibrating their personalities to achieve optimal compatibility. It was working and it was exhausting.

"This is nice," Rachel said, and meant it within the narrow parameters of what nice could mean on a Friday night in Brooklyn.

"It is," Ethan agreed, and meant it even less.

The check arrived in a leather folder that suggested sophistication. Ethan reached for it—the gesture expected—and Rachel performed the wallet reach that wouldn't complete. They'd split dessert wine neither wanted. The math of modern dating.

Outside, the September air carried hints of autumn. Couples passed in both directions, some beginning their nights, others ending them. Ethan and Rachel stood in that awkward space between goodbye and what comes next.

"I had a really good time," Rachel said, the script requiring these words.

"Me too."

The kiss was inevitable—brief, competent, tasting of wine and emptiness. It was the kind of kiss that suggested potential without promising anything, perfectly calibrated for a first date that went well enough.

"Want to share an Uber?" Rachel asked.

They sat in the backseat with careful space between them, watching Brooklyn pass in the darkness. Her phone illuminated her face in short bursts as she responded to messages. Ethan watched the driver's GPS count down to her address, relief and disappointment mixing in equal measure.

"This is me," she said as they pulled up to a brownstone that looked like every other aspirational Brooklyn building. Another kiss, lighter than the first. "Text me?"

"Definitely."

He wouldn't. They both knew he wouldn't.

The Uber continued toward his apartment, the driver silent now, perhaps sensing the peculiar loneliness of a passenger returning home alone on a Friday night. Ethan pulled out his phone, opened Hinge, began swiping without seeing. The faces blurred past—Amanda who loved tacos and travel, Jennifer who was fluent in sarcasm, Michelle who was looking for her partner in crime.

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Haven't heard from you in weeks. Your grandmother would be disappointed."

The words hit like ice water. Ethan stared at the message, thumb hovering over the keyboard. He hadn't thought about his grandmother in months. Why did her name make his chest tighten? What would she be disappointed about—his dating life? His absence from family dinners? Or something deeper, something he'd lost so gradually he hadn't noticed it was gone?

The Uber pulled up to his building. Ethan paid, tipped well—compensation for his emptiness—and climbed the stairs to his apartment. Inside, he stood at his window looking out at Brooklyn's lights, each one representing someone else's Friday night, someone else's attempt at connection.

He thought about Rachel, probably already in bed, scrolling through apps, queuing up tomorrow's matches. He thought about the thirty-six women before her, their faces blending into one composite of educated, attractive, culturally Jewish ambivalence. He thought about his grandmother, who'd met his grandfather at nineteen and loved him until she died, who'd never needed an algorithm to tell her what she was looking for.

Ethan opened his dating apps again, but this time he didn't swipe. He just stared at the grid of faces, all promising connection, all offering the same branded loneliness he was selling in return. 

Somewhere in Brooklyn, church bells chimed ten o'clock. Or maybe they were just wind chimes. He couldn't tell the difference anymore.
