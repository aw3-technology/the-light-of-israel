# Chapter 2: The Dating App Carousel

Ethan had been swiping for forty-five minutes and couldn't remember a single face.

Left, left, left, right, left—Brooklyn dusk bleeding orange through his window while profiles blurred past. Yoga poses at sunset, startup founders at Machu Picchu, everyone declaring love for both adventures and lazy Sundays. Sarah had called him "emotionally absent" eight months ago. She was right, but knowing didn't make him any more present.

Rachel Klein would be his thirty-seventh first date since Sarah. Her message had cut through the noise: "Your bio says you optimize user journeys. Can you optimize this awkward opening message?" Direct. Funny enough. Wednesday evening date—low stakes, easy exit.

Before his bathroom mirror: dark jeans, navy button-down. Sarah had called it his dating uniform, said it brought out his eyes—"beautifully vacant."

His reflection looked competent and hollow. Somewhere in that face was Ethan Israel Stone, but tonight he'd be just Ethan—product manager, Brooklyn resident, the kind of Jewish that meant knowing about bagels and anxiety but nothing about why his grandmother had covered her eyes when lighting candles, whispering prayers that made their cramped apartment expand into something infinite.

The time read 7:18 PM. Three days until her yahrzeit. He hadn't lit a candle last year.

The Uber driver's name was Abraham. Of course it was.

"Going somewhere nice?" Abraham asked, accent carrying warmth from somewhere Ethan had never visited.

"Just meeting someone."

"Ah." Abraham's eyes found his in the mirror. "You'll find what you're looking for, my friend. Sometimes not where you expect."

The ride took 5 minutes and 41 seconds while Ethan studied Rachel's profile: marketing at a wellness startup, Northwestern, Columbia MBA, Fort Greene. In her photos she held wine glasses at gallery openings where the lighting was always golden hour.

Three couples exited as he arrived. Perfect timing.

Rachel sat in the second booth, exactly like her photos—both relief and disappointment. Expensive highlights, delicate gold jewelry, studied effortlessness. A small scar above her left eyebrow that her fingers kept finding.

Brief embrace. Bergamot and ginger.

"You made it through Brooklyn traffic."

"Not too bad." She'd taken the seat facing out, watching the door.

"Can I start you with something?"

Rachel ordered orange wine before he'd opened the menu. "Trust me," she said, fingers on his wrist for exactly two seconds. "It's having a moment."

"So tell me about optimizing user journeys," she said, leaning forward. "Your profile made it sound almost interesting."

"I figure out why people abandon their shopping carts."

"The hero late capitalism deserves." Her laugh was surprisingly loud, unguarded. She covered her mouth, embarrassed. "Sorry, I snort when I actually laugh."

"Don't apologize. It's the first real thing I've heard all week."

"Real is dangerous on first dates."

The wine arrived—orange, cloudy, from the Golan Heights though neither knew the significance.

"To Wednesday night in Brooklyn."

Apricot and dust. Around them, identical rituals.

"Besides the thrilling world of abandoned carts," Rachel said, "what else?"

"The usual. Trying to read more, cook more. You?"

"Yoga teacher training I'll never start. Spanish on an app. Attempting to keep a fiddle-leaf fig alive. It's winning."

She pulled her sleeves over her hands when she talked, suddenly younger.

"So, Ethan—biblical name."

"My parents were going through a phase."

"My parents named me after my great-grandmother. She escaped Poland in '39, last boat out of Gdańsk. Twenty years old, everything in one suitcase, your entire family waving goodbye forever."

Something tightened in Ethan's chest. His grandmother had been twenty-two when she left Berlin.

"That's..." He should say something, share his own grandmother's story, create a real moment. Instead: "Heavy for a first date."

Rachel's face closed like a door. "Right. Sorry. Wine makes me weird."

"No, I didn't mean—"

"It's fine. Let's talk about Iceland. Have you been?"

Safer ground: Northern Lights, Tokyo confusion. Small plates with precious names. Rachel photographing, posting. Beautiful food that tasted like nothing.

"What happened with your last relationship?" Rachel asked, cutting into burrata that bled white across the plate.

"We wanted different things."

"Translation: she wanted you to feel something."

The accuracy stung. "What about you?"

"He moved to San Francisco. Said I was too much and not enough simultaneously."

Her phone lit up. She glanced, turned it over. His phone vibrated—his mother, ignored. 

"Want to know something?" Rachel said, wine softening her edges. "I've been on probably fifty first dates this year. They all blur together. Same conversations, same—" She gestured at the space between them.

"Same nothing?"

"Exactly. Like we're all auditioning for roles but nobody knows what the play is."

"Digital diaspora," he said without thinking.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just... wandering."

Rachel studied him. "My grandmother used to say we were all in exile until we found our way home. Never knew what she meant." Bitter laugh. "Probably Israel."

Ethan's grandmother had said the same thing. Had died saying it.

"Anyway." Rachel reached for her wine. "That's enough family trauma for one appetizer course."

The server brought dessert menus. They ordered another round instead.

"What time is it?" Rachel asked.

"Nine-eleven."

They kissed then, across the table—urgent but empty, pressing mouths against glass.

"This is nice," Rachel said, pulling back.

"It is."

The check arrived. Ethan reached for it automatically; Rachel did the wallet dance. Outside, September air carried hints of autumn and somewhere, distant singing—maybe from the Chabad house, maybe just Brooklyn ambient noise.

"I had a good time," Rachel said, because the script required it.

Another kiss—brief, final. The Uber: 5 minutes 41 seconds, careful space between them. Her face lit by her phone screen.

"This is me." A brownstone like every other. Another kiss, lighter than air. "Text me?"

"Definitely."

Through her window: the blue glow of her phone, thumb already swiping. He watched her disappear into the same carousel they'd both just performed in person.

Back home, the app opened itself. The same faces from this morning, rearranged.

His mother: "Three days until Grandma's yahrzeit. Will you light a candle this year?"

His thumb stopped mid-swipe. Rachel's grandmother, last boat from Gdańsk. His grandmother, train from Berlin. Both women planting themselves in American soil, whispering prayers their grandchildren wouldn't understand.

He could text Rachel. Tell her about Berlin, about candles, about forgetting.

Instead, he closed the blinds against the Chabad house singing. Against the Brooklyn night. Against everything except strangers' faces, each one a door to the same empty room.

October 13th. Three days.

Somewhere in this apartment was a yahrzeit candle he'd bought last year and never lit.
