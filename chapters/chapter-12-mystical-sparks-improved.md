# Chapter 12: Mystical Sparks

The Zohar fell open to a page about hidden light, and Ethan felt his grandmother's presence in the room.

Rabbi Levi's study—walls of Hebrew texts, leather bindings cracking with age, menorah shadows dancing. But tonight the October darkness pressing against the windows held electricity.

"You asked why you feel broken." Rabbi Levi squinted at the text, his finger following right to left. "Shevirat HaKelim. The Breaking of the Vessels."

Ethan shifted. His product manager mind wanted a problem statement, not mysticism. "Rabbi, I need practical—"

"You design products, yes? First you create space. Withdraw other features."

"Yes, but—"

"Tzimtzum." The rabbi's arthritic fingers struggled with the heavy Zohar, pages stuck together with centuries. "Divine contraction. Without withdrawal, nothing could exist."

Ethan helped separate the pages, feeling the paper's texture—rough, almost alive. A margin note in faded brown ink caught his eye: "The breaking is the beginning."

"Like depression is withdrawal?"

"Or making space for something new."

The rabbi traced ten circles on the table, connecting them with shaky lines. His hand trembled—age or intensity, Ethan couldn't tell. "The vessels meant to contain divine light—they shattered."

"They weren't strong enough?"

"They were exactly as strong as needed." Coffee stains marked the diagram from previous lessons. Real stains, real paper, not the pristine PDFs Ethan was used to. "Breaking wasn't failure. It was the beginning of repair."

Ethan tried reading the Hebrew beneath the diagram. Mem looked like Nun. Bet looked like Kaf. The letters swam. "I can't even read this properly."

"Good. Knowing you don't know is the beginning."

"But I feel empty. Like I'm performing life without—"

"Every dating app swipe, every late-night scroll—you're looking for light." Rabbi Levi's knowing look made Ethan squirm. "But looking through exile, as exile."

The rabbi stood with effort, knees cracking, and pulled down a book that shed leather flakes. "Your grandmother knew this. Rivka Stone. She brought you here once."

"When?"

"You were seven."

Memory flickered—dark wood, his grandmother's hand sticky with summer heat. "I don't remember."

"She understood broken vessels. Every survivor does." The rabbi opened to a page. The binding cracked. "Try reading this."

Ethan struggled with the Hebrew. "Or... Or Ha..."

"Or HaGanuz. Hidden Light." Rabbi Levi corrected his pronunciation. "Again."

"Or HaGanuz."

"Better. The primordial light, hidden in the Torah, in souls, in moments of truth. In you, Ethan Israel."

"In me?" Ethan laughed, bitter. "I eat bacon. I haven't been to synagogue since—"

"Seven-eighteen."

Ethan froze. "What?"

"Your name's gematria. The time you wake up. Your coffee price at that Brooklyn cafe."

"That's just... pattern matching. Confirmation bias."

"Maybe." The rabbi drew the Tree of Life again, this time his hand shook worse. "Keter, Chochmah, Binah..." He stopped, rubbed his eyes. "I'm forgetting the order. Chesed next or—no, that's right. Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet..."

Ethan watched the old man struggle, suddenly seeing him as human, fallible. "Can I help?"

"This isn't just divine emanation. It's your consciousness. Your depression—Gevurah without Chesed. Judgment without mercy."

"This sounds like metaphor."

"How else could the Infinite speak to a Brooklyn product manager?"

Despite himself, Ethan almost smiled. Then: "My grandmother knew all this?"

"She knew about gathering sparks in darkness. Especially there."

Rabbi Levi wrote out Hebrew letters, slowly, painfully. His handwriting was barely legible. "Study this before sleep. Friday—light Shabbat candles."

"I don't know the prayers."

"So learn. Or don't. The light doesn't care about perfect pronunciation."

Walking home, Ethan felt different. Not fixed. Just... oriented. Like holding a map in a language he couldn't read but his hands remembered.

In his apartment, behind old cables and dust: his grandmother's candlesticks. Tarnished green-black at the joints. One was dented. Real damage on real brass.

He set them next to his coffee maker. Sacred beside mundane.

That night, studying Rabbi Levi's barely legible Hebrew, he had to guess half the letters. The passage was about gathering sparks. Or maybe about lifting fallen things. His Hebrew wasn't good enough to be sure.

He tried to light a practice candle. The match broke. The second match burned his fingers. The third lit but the candle wouldn't catch—the wick was buried in wax.

He dug it out with a kitchen knife, getting wax under his fingernails. Finally, a flame. It guttered, almost died, then steadied.

At 2 AM, instead of his phone, he stood at his window. Each city light a spark. Each one in exile.

He texted Rabbi Levi: "I think I'm beginning to understand."

No response. The rabbi was probably asleep, or couldn't find his phone, or had forgotten to charge it. Human limitations. Real world.

Friday was two days away. He googled "Shabbat candle blessing." Fifteen different versions came up. Which was right? Did it matter?

His grandmother's voice in memory: "To remember. To not forget."

But what exactly was he supposed to remember? The prayers? The traditions? Her?

The candlesticks sat on his counter, waiting. One still had old wax in it—his grandmother's? Someone else's? How many Friday nights had they held light?

He scraped out the old wax, his fingernail blackening. Physical work. Actual cleaning. Not metaphorical. Not mystical. Just brass and wax and the effort to make space for new light.

The sparks were everywhere, maybe. And maybe he was ready to start gathering them.

Or maybe he'd just light candles badly and feel foolish.

Either way, Friday was coming.
