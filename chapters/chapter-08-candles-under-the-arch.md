# Chapter 8: Candles Under the Arch

The candles appeared first—one, then dozens, then hundreds, flickering against October darkness like a constellation lowered to Washington Square Park.

Sunday evening, October 8th. The subway ride from Brooklyn felt like crossing into foreign territory that was somehow also a homecoming. At 14th Street, he could already see them through the train window—the mass of bodies gathering with their pinpricks of light.

He'd seen the announcement on Instagram while lying in bed at 4 PM, still in yesterday's clothes, the screen's blue light the only illumination in his apartment where curtains stayed drawn against a Sunday that felt too raw for sunshine. "Vigil for the Victims—Washington Square Park, 7 PM, Bring Light Against Darkness." The graphics simple, stark—a candle, a Star of David, the date October 7th as a set of digits he couldn't stop looking at.

Not his community—the thought automatic, practiced through decades of being Jew-ish, not Jewish.

But his thumb had screenshotted it anyway. His body had risen, showered, dressed. The black shirt was unintentional but appropriate. On the platform, the overhead fluorescents hummed at a frequency that made his teeth ache, or maybe that was just the tension he'd been carrying since yesterday.

The train carried others toward the same destination. An elderly couple spoke Hebrew in whispers, the woman's knuckles white where she gripped the pole. Three college girls in Columbia sweatshirts passed a phone between them, mascara streaking their cheeks. A father steadied two children as the train lurched—the boy maybe eight, clutching a Yankees kippah that kept sliding off his head, the girl younger, her Star of David necklace tangled in her hair.

"Are we going to pray, Abba?" the boy asked.

"We're going to remember," the father answered, and something in his voice made Ethan look away, out the window into tunnel darkness that reflected his own face back strange, distorted, more honest than mirrors.

At Union Square, the demographic shifted. A woman wrapped an Israeli flag around her shoulders, the fabric worn soft at the edges. Two Hasidic men argued in rapid Yiddish—one kept saying "But the Rebbe said," while the other countered with something about Pittsburgh, about Poway, about how nowhere was safe anymore.

Ethan stood though seats emptied around him. The metal rail was cold under his palm, grounding. His phone showed seventeen missed calls from his mother, three from Aaron, one from a number he didn't recognize but that had a 972 country code—Israel, though he knew no one there, had never been, had avoided Israel like he'd avoided everything that might make claims on his carefully maintained neutrality.

The walk from the station took forever and no time at all. The October wind carried the smell of burning leaves from somewhere, though there were no trees burning in Manhattan, just candles—hundreds of them already visible as he turned onto Washington Square Park South.

The Washington Square Arch, usually lit by streetlamps, now flickered with candlelight reflected in its marble. The crowd was already thick—bodies pressed close enough that Ethan could smell someone's lavender perfume mixing with the smoke from havdalah candles someone had brought, the wrong ritual for the moment—and somehow right anyway.
He checked his phone as he stepped under the arch: 7:17 PM.

A hand materialized holding a yahrzeit candle—thick glass, the kind you buy at Key Food for $2.99. The woman attached to it had deep-set eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, a scar running through her left eyebrow. She didn't speak, just touched her flame to his wick. The fire jumped between them, and she was gone before he could thank her.

"First time?" The woman wore an IDF t-shirt under an open cardigan, her hair pulled back with what looked like a child's scrunchie—purple with glitter stars.

"First time what?"

"Being with us. You have that look—like you're surprised you came."

She pressed something into his hand—a photocopied sheet with Hebrew songs transliterated into English. The paper was still warm from the copy shop. Someone near the fountain had started "Hatikvah," but a younger voice interrupted with "Od Yavo Shalom Aleinu," and for a moment the two melodies tangled, competed, before settling into an uneasy harmony.

"Acheinu kol beit yisrael." The prayer for captives. An older man with a Zabar's tote bag was leading it, his voice cracking on the high notes. Behind him, someone muttered that this wasn't the right prayer, but the man kept going.

Ethan found himself humming along, wordless but in rhythm, his throat tight with unfamiliar melody that felt like remembering.

The speeches began late. Someone had brought a portable PA system that kept cutting out, making the speakers sound like they were broadcasting from underground. The mic cord was patched with silver duct tape that caught the candlelight.

A man in a Knicks jersey took the microphone, the sports logo jarring against his grief: "My sister is still missing. Noa. She's twenty-four. She was at the music festival." His voice broke. "She texted me a video of the sunrise. Then nothing."

The crowd's silence had texture—broken by sniffles, by the rustle of tissues pulled from pockets, by someone's phone playing a CNN alert they couldn't silence fast enough. Near Ethan, a woman whispered "Baruch Dayan HaEmet" while the man beside her muttered something about how God had nothing to do with this, and didn't she remember the Holocaust?

More speakers. Each story a world destroyed. Parents, children, friends, dancers, soldiers, farmers, peaceniks, right-wing, left-wing, no-wing, just humans who'd been alive yesterday and weren't today, whose absence created presence, whose silence demanded speech, whose darkness made these candles necessary, essential, not enough but something, the only something available.

The rabbi wore jeans under his tallit, Adidas sneakers that had seen better days. His beard was uneven, like he'd trimmed it himself with dull scissors:

"We are here because—" The mic squealed. He adjusted it, tried again. "We are here because we don't know where else to be. Some of you believe in God. Some don't. Some did yesterday but don't today. That's okay. Tonight we're not here for God. We're here for each other."

The counter-protesters had been there all along, Ethan realized—he just hadn't noticed them until their drum started. He jumped at the first strike without meaning to. A djembe, played with professional skill. Their signs were LED-lit, battery-powered, impossible to ignore: "RESISTANCE IS NOT TERRORISM." "FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA." One girl who couldn't be older than nineteen held a poster with photos of dead Palestinian children.

Half the Jewish crowd turned to look. The other half deliberately didn't. A young woman in a Hebrew University sweatshirt shouted: "Today? Really? TODAY?"

"They have a right to protest," said someone.

"Not today they don't."

The argument rippled through the crowd, fracturing what had felt unified. A man stepped toward the protesters. Others pulled him back. Someone called him a traitor. Someone else called the first someone a fascist.

The rabbi's voice cracked through the PA system: "Please. Please. We're losing each other here." But his words were drowned out by competing chants—"Am Yisrael Chai" from one side, "Free Palestine" from the other, and in the middle, people just trying to say Kaddish for the dead who deserved better than becoming political props.

The crowd began to fragment. Some moved toward the counter-protesters, others formed a protective circle around the mourners' kaddish. Ethan found himself in the gap between—not choosing sides because both were his side, neither was his side, the whole thing was impossible and necessary simultaneously. His throat burned with unshed tears and unspoken arguments.

An elderly man with numbers tattooed on his forearm grabbed Ethan's elbow: "You see? Even now, even in our grief, we fight each other. This is also Jewish."

"Is that supposed to be comforting?"

"Comfort?" The man laughed, bitter and fond. "Who promised comfort? We argue because we care. The dead don't get to argue anymore."

"I don't even know what I believe."

"Good. Believe in that. Just don't stay home with it." His grip was surprisingly strong. "That's when it becomes a problem."

The crowd was dissolving into factions—those heading to a shiva, those joining the protesters, those simply going home. Ethan stood between the streams of people, catching fragments: "...my therapist says..." "...never should have come..." "...what would the Rebbe say..." "...fucking Brooklyn gentrifiers..." The sacred and profane tangled together, inseparable.

His phone vibrated against his ribs. Aaron: "Saw you on the news. You okay?"

The park smelled like extinguished candles now—that particular mix of smoke and melted wax that would forever mean this night.

A Parks Department employee in a reflective vest was sweeping up programs, his broom scraping against concrete in a rhythm like davening. The counter-protesters had moved on to arguing among themselves about tactics. The djembe player was packing up, the drum's heartbeat finally silent.

The walk to the subway—past the closed falafel shop with its faded Hebrew lettering, past the NYU dorm where someone had already hung an Israeli flag from their window, past a homeless man who called out "Shalom aleichem" either in greeting or mockery, impossible to tell. His reflection in the bodega window showed wax on his sleeve, ash on his collar.

He walked the Brooklyn Bridge instead of taking the train—needed the wind off the East River, the way it carried salt and diesel and something ancient. The cables hummed above him at a frequency he felt in his molars.

His apartment building's door required three tries with the key—his hands were shaking. The hallway smelled like his neighbor's curry, usually comforting but tonight too present.

A piece of paper taped to his door. Not white—yellowed, like it had been saved from something else. His name in Hebrew letters, but also something else in the corner—a phone number with a 718 area code. Brooklyn. The tape was the medical kind, the kind his grandmother used to use for everything.

Inside, pencil marks—not pen, pencil, like someone wasn't sure they should be writing this. Hebrew he couldn't read, but also a map. Hand-drawn. His block, his building, but also other marks—six other buildings circled. At the bottom, in shaky English:

"Thursday 7pm. We're starting again."

Starting what? The paper smelled faintly of cigarettes and brisket. Real. Specific. Not mystical—just someone's grandmother or grandfather who'd been watching, waiting, knowing that crisis makes Jews remember they're Jews.

His apartment was exactly as he'd left it except for the candlesticks—his grandmother's candlesticks that he used for holding mail. Tonight they looked like what they were: ritual objects waiting.

Thursday was in four days.
