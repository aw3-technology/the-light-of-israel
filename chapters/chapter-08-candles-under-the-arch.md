# Chapter 8: Candles Under the Arch

The candles appeared first—one, then dozens, then hundreds, flickering against October darkness like a constellation lowered to Washington Square Park.

Sunday evening, October 8th. The subway ride from Brooklyn felt like crossing into foreign territory that was somehow also a homecoming. At 14th Street, he could already see them through the train window—the mass of bodies gathering with their pinpricks of light.

He'd seen the announcement on Instagram while lying in bed at 4 PM, still in yesterday's clothes, the screen's blue light the only illumination in his apartment where curtains stayed drawn against a Sunday that felt too raw for sunshine. "Vigil for the Victims—Washington Square Park, 7 PM, Bring Light Against Darkness." The graphics simple, stark—a candle, a Star of David, the date October 7th as a set of digits he couldn't stop looking at.


But his thumb had screenshotted it anyway. His body had risen, showered, dressed. The black shirt was unintentional but appropriate. On the platform, the overhead fluorescents hummed at a frequency that made his teeth ache, or maybe that was just the tension he'd been carrying since yesterday.

The train carried others toward the same destination. An elderly couple spoke Hebrew in whispers, the woman's knuckles white where she gripped the pole. Three college girls in Columbia sweatshirts passed a phone between them, mascara streaking their cheeks. A father steadied two children as the train lurched—the boy maybe eight, clutching a Yankees kippah that kept sliding off his head, the girl younger, her Star of David necklace tangled in her hair.

"Are we going to pray, Abba?" the boy asked.

"We're going to remember," the father answered, and something in his voice made Ethan look away, out the window into tunnel darkness.

At Union Square, the demographic shifted. A woman wrapped an Israeli flag around her shoulders, the fabric worn soft at the edges. Two Hasidic men argued in rapid Yiddish—one kept saying "But the Rebbe said," while the other countered with something about Pittsburgh, about Poway, about how nowhere was safe anymore.

Ethan stood though seats emptied around him. The metal rail was cold under his palm, grounding. His phone screen was dark. He'd turned it off somewhere between Brooklyn and here.

The walk from the station took forever and no time at all. The October wind carried the smell of burning leaves from somewhere, though there were no trees burning in Manhattan, just candles—hundreds of them already visible as he turned onto Washington Square Park South.

The crowd was already thick—bodies pressed close enough that Ethan could smell someone's lavender perfume mixing with the smoke from candles.
He checked his phone as he stepped under the arch: 7:17 PM.

A hand materialized holding a yahrzeit candle—thick glass, the kind you buy at Key Food for $2.99. The woman attached to it had deep-set eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, a scar running through her left eyebrow. She didn't speak, just touched her flame to his wick. The fire jumped between them.

"Wait," Ethan heard himself say. "Thank you."

She paused, studied him. "First yahrzeit candle?"

"First everything."

"Then you'll need another." She pressed a second candle into his free hand. "For whoever you haven't mourned yet."

She vanished into the crowd before he could ask what she meant.

Someone near the fountain had started "Hatikvah," but a younger voice interrupted with "Od Yavo Shalom Aleinu," and for a moment the two melodies tangled, competed, before settling into an uneasy harmony.

"Acheinu kol beit yisrael." The prayer for captives. Someone was leading it, voice cracking on the high notes.

Ethan found himself not just humming but mouthing the words—words he didn't know he knew. His hand moved to steady the second candle, and without thinking, he lit it from the first.

The speeches began late. Someone had brought a portable PA system that kept cutting out, making the speakers sound like they were broadcasting from underground. The mic cord was patched with silver duct tape that caught the candlelight.

A man in a Knicks jersey took the microphone, the sports logo jarring against his grief: "My sister is still missing. Noa. She's twenty-four. She was at the music festival." His voice broke. "She texted me a video of the sunrise. Then nothing."

The crowd's silence had texture—broken by sniffles, by the rustle of tissues pulled from pockets, by someone's phone playing a CNN alert they couldn't silence fast enough. Near Ethan, a woman whispered "Baruch Dayan HaEmet" while the man beside her muttered something about how God had nothing to do with this, and didn't she remember the Holocaust?

More speakers. Each story a world destroyed. Parents, children, friends, dancers, soldiers, farmers, peaceniks, right-wing, left-wing, no-wing, just humans who'd been alive yesterday and weren't today, whose absence created presence, whose silence demanded speech, whose darkness made these candles necessary, essential, not enough but something, the only something available.

The rabbi wore jeans under his tallit, Adidas sneakers that had seen better days. His beard was uneven, like he'd trimmed it himself with dull scissors:

"We are here because—" The mic squealed. He adjusted it, tried again. "We are here because we don't know where else to be. Some of you believe in God. Some don't. Some did yesterday but don't today. That's okay. Tonight we're not here for God. We're here for each other."

The drum started somewhere behind him—djembe rhythms that didn't match the moment. Ethan caught fragments: a young woman's voice cracking on "Really? TODAY?" Someone else shouting back about occupation. An older man trying to pull someone away from something.

Through it all, the Kaddish continued—voices growing hoarse, wavering, but not stopping.

Ethan found himself moving to the Kaddish circle. He raised his second candle higher, adding his light to theirs. "Yitgadal v'yitkadash," he whispered, the words coming from somewhere he'd forgotten he knew.

An elderly man with numbers tattooed on his forearm grabbed Ethan's elbow: "You see? Even now, even in our grief, we fight. This is also Jewish."

"Is that supposed to be comforting?"

"Comfort?" The man laughed. "Who promised comfort? We argue because we care. The dead don't argue anymore."

"I don't even know what I believe."

"So you came anyway." The man pointed to Ethan's two candles. "One for them, one for you."

The crowd dissolved into streams. Ethan stood holding his two candles, wax dripping onto his sleeves—one for the dead, one for his grandmother, both for something he was only beginning to understand.


The park smelled like extinguished candles—smoke and melted wax that would forever mean this night.

The park was emptying. Someone was sweeping up programs, broom scraping against concrete.

The walk home—wax on his sleeve, ash on his collar. The bridge wind carrying salt and diesel and something ancient.

His apartment was exactly as he'd left it—mail scattered on the counter, yesterday's coffee mug in the sink.

He set his two yahrzeit candles on the kitchen counter. One still burning for October 7th's dead. One for his grandmother, finally lit after a year of darkness.

Two flames in the kitchen window, reflecting back at him through black glass.
