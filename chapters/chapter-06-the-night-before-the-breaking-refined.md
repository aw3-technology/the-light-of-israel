# Chapter 6: The Night Before the Breaking

The candlesticks on his counter seemed to glow in the darkness, though he hadn't lit them.

Friday night, October 6th. Three missed calls from his mother. One text from Aaron: "Still on for coffee tomorrow?"

Tomorrow. Saturday. October 7th. Something about the date scratched inside his skull.

Thai food sat untouched, smelling wrong. His stomach turned with that feeling before flights, before news that changes everything. Except he had no flights, no news coming.

Outside, Brooklyn continued its Friday night rhythm while something gathered at the edges of perception.

The candlesticks caught his eye. His grandmother's brass holders, discovered that afternoon in the closet. Unlit. Friday night at 8:41 PM.

He picked them up—heavier than memory. His fingers found grooves worn by her hands, decades of Friday nights carved into brass. Almost without thinking, he set them on the counter, reached for matches. His hand stopped mid-air. What was the blessing? What came after lighting? The not-knowing felt like locked doors, like being outside his own inheritance.

He set the matches down. Tomorrow, maybe. After coffee with Aaron.

Browser tabs multiplied: "Hebrew letter meanings" (clicked by accident, closed, reopened). "Tensions escalate along Gaza border."

Mom texted about a TV show. He replied "Love you too."

The exhaustion hit suddenly—soul exhaustion, the kind sleep couldn't cure. He collapsed onto unmade sheets. The candlesticks pulsed in his peripheral vision, or maybe that was just tired eyes seeing patterns in nothing.

Sleep came wrong—too fast, falling past dream into something older.

Trees burning but not consumed. Each flame a letter, each branch a name he almost recognized.

"Israel," the burning said.

His grandmother's voice, but distant. Not quite words, fragments carried on smoke: "Tomorrow... changes... wrestling makes... name true..."

The burning trees became wall—infinite wall reaching past sight. His hand found warm stone, pulse beneath rock. From every crack, prayers fell like ash, dissolving before he could read them.

He pressed both palms against the wall, felt it pulse back.

"I don't know the prayers," he said.

Her voice, fainter now: "You are... the prayer..."

The wall cracked. Light spilled through—not bright but present, waiting.

Then fragments, dissolving: "Tomorrow... world... light in..."

The dream scattered like ash.

3:29 AM.

He woke to sheets twisted into shapes that might have been Hebrew letters. The apartment felt different—darker than dark should be. Were the streetlights out? Or had something else changed?

The candlesticks in the kitchen—glowing or just reflecting something? Brass conducting energy or just catching light from sources he couldn't identify.

He stumbled to the bathroom, looked in the mirror. His face seemed different. Not changed but revealed. Or was that just 3 AM face, the way everyone looked in fluorescent light after strange dreams?

The apartment held that specific 3 AM quality—when walls thin between worlds, when every sound could be significant or nothing. The refrigerator hummed its mechanical mantra. Somewhere, a siren wailed and faded. He stood at the threshold between kitchen and bedroom, caught in that liminal space where decision felt impossible. Light the candles now? Return to bed? He chose neither, standing in his boxers in the dark, feeling the weight of something approaching.

Back to bed. Sleep came floating now, lucid but distant. In the space between dreams, his grandmother sat at a Sabbath table. Waiting.

"Soon," she said. Or he imagined she said. Or needed her to say.

5:41 AM.

Dawn preparing but not yet broken. Birds gathering song. His phone: completely dead. He plugged it in, watched the apple appear, disappear—the daily resurrection of connectivity—then set it face-down on the nightstand.

He thought about shower. About coffee. Instead he pulled the blanket over his head. Saturday could wait.

The candlesticks just brass again. Inheritance on a counter. Had they been glowing? Or had that been streetlight, dream-logic, the way tiredness made everything seem significant?

On the nightstand, his phone finished its resurrection under Do Not Disturb. Notifications loaded, banners stacking in silence.

6:47 AM.

In five seconds, the world would break.
In four seconds, history would pivot.
In three seconds, everything would become before and after.
In two seconds—
In one—

The birds stopped singing.
Brooklyn held its breath.
October 7th.

His phone began to buzz against wood—muted, insistent, unheard.

Not one notification but dozens, hundreds. Breaking news becoming broken world. The buzz becoming roar becoming the sound everything makes when it discovers distance is illusion, safety temporary.

But for this moment—this last moment before the world divided—Ethan Stone slept in his bed in Brooklyn, candlesticks waiting in the kitchen.

Had his grandmother's dream been prophecy or warning? Had the candlesticks glowed or just reflected his need to see light in the darkness coming?

Israel.
The wrestling was about to begin.

In his last moment of sleep, his hand moved—reaching for something, grasping air. As if already practicing for the prayer he didn't know he'd need.

His phone buzzed again.
And again.
And again.
