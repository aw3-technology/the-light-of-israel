# Chapter 6: The Night Before the Breaking

The candlesticks on his counter seemed to glow in the darkness, though he hadn't lit them.

Friday night, October 6th. Three missed calls from his mother. One text from Aaron: "Still on for coffee tomorrow?"

Tomorrow. Saturday. October 7th. Something about the date scratched inside his skull.

Thai food sat untouched, smelling wrong. His stomach turned with that feeling before flights, before news that changes everything. Except he had no flights, no news coming.

Outside, Brooklyn continued its Friday night rhythm while something gathered at the edges of perception.

The candlesticks caught his eye. His grandmother's brass holders, discovered that afternoon in the closet. Unlit.

He picked them up—heavier than memory. His fingers found grooves worn by her hands, decades of Friday nights carved into brass. This time he struck a match. The flame wavered, then caught.

He held it close to the first wick, close enough to feel heat. The wax began to soften.

Then blew it out.

Not hesitation this time—choice. Some moments required darkness before light. Some preparations took longer than striking matches.

He set the burnt match aside. Soon, maybe. But not yet.

Browser tabs multiplied: "Hebrew letter meanings" (clicked by accident, closed, reopened). "Tensions escalate along Gaza border."

Mom texted about a TV show. He replied "Love you too."

The exhaustion hit suddenly—soul exhaustion, the kind sleep couldn't cure. He collapsed onto unmade sheets. The candlesticks pulsed in his peripheral vision, or maybe that was just tired eyes seeing patterns in nothing.

Sleep came wrong—too fast, falling past dream into something older.

Trees burning but not consumed. Each flame a letter, each branch a name he almost recognized.

"Israel," the burning said.

His grandmother's voice, but distant. Not quite words, fragments carried on smoke: "Tomorrow... changes... wrestling makes... name true..."

The burning trees became wall—infinite wall reaching past sight. His hand found warm stone, pulse beneath rock. From every crack, prayers fell like ash, dissolving before he could read them.

He pressed both palms against the wall, felt it pulse back.

"I don't know the prayers," he said.

Her voice, fainter now: "You are... the prayer..."

The wall cracked. Light spilled through—not bright but present, waiting.

Then fragments, dissolving: "Tomorrow... world... light in..."

The dream scattered like ash.

3:29 AM.

He woke to sheets twisted into shapes that might have been Hebrew letters. The apartment felt different—darker than dark should be. Were the streetlights out? Or had something else changed?

The candlesticks in the kitchen—glowing or just reflecting something? Brass conducting energy or just catching light from sources he couldn't identify.

He stumbled to the bathroom, looked in the mirror. His face seemed different. Not changed but revealed. Or was that just 3 AM face, the way everyone looked in fluorescent light after strange dreams?

The apartment held that specific 3 AM quality—when walls thin between worlds, when every sound could be significant or nothing. The refrigerator hummed its mechanical mantra. Somewhere, a siren wailed and faded. He stood at the threshold between kitchen and bedroom, caught in that liminal space where decision felt impossible. Light the candles now? Return to bed? He chose neither, standing in his boxers in the dark, feeling the weight of something approaching.

Back to bed. Sleep came floating now, lucid but distant. In the space between dreams, his grandmother sat at a Sabbath table. Waiting.

"Soon," she said. Or he imagined she said. Or needed her to say.

---

Dawn preparing but not yet broken. Birds gathering song. His phone: completely dead. He plugged it in, watched the apple appear, disappear—then set it face-down on the nightstand.

He thought about shower. About coffee. Instead he pulled the blanket over his head. Saturday could wait.

The candlesticks just brass again. Inheritance on a counter. Had they been glowing? Or had that been streetlight, dream-logic, the way tiredness made everything seem significant?

On the nightstand, his phone finished its resurrection under Do Not Disturb. Notifications loaded, banners stacking in silence.

6:47 AM.

One candle, somehow lit.

He stared at it through half-sleep. Had he lit it in the dream? Was this still the dream? The flame steady, impossible.

His phone began to vibrate. Once. Twice. Then silence.

From the kitchen, the scent of something burning—not wax, something else. Sweet and acrid.

The silence stretched. Even the birds had stopped.

Ethan Stone reached toward the nightstand, toward the phone that held messages he hadn't read yet, toward a day that felt different from all the days before.

The candle burned.
The phone waited.
October 7th began.
