# Chapter 4: Family Distance

His mother called three times before Ethan answered, and even then, he almost let it go to voicemail.

Thursday evening, September 28th, his apartment dark at 6:54 PM. The phone vibrated against the coffee table, each buzz a small earthquake of obligation.

First call: ignored while microwaving Thai food.
Second call: watched her photo light up the screen.
Third call: surrender.

"Hi, Mom."

"Finally! I was starting to worry. You know how I worry when you don't answer."

Netflix frozen mid-episode of Love is Blind, someone's face twisted in what the subtitles called "[ANGUISHED EXPRESSION]"—discovering betrayal in the pods, mouth forming words that looked exactly like what Ethan couldn't say. He left it paused, the frozen moment more honest than anything about to happen.

"Sorry, I was just—" The words caught. His mouth opened to say "drowning" but what came out was: "Working late."

"Always working. Your father's here. David, it's Ethan!"

Through the phone: dishwasher hum, news voices, ice against glass.

"How's Dad?"

"Golf three times this week. His back's acting up." A pause. "How are you, honey? Really?"

The 'really' hung in the air like a door held open exactly three inches—enough to suggest entrance, not enough to actually enter.

"I'm good. Busy with work. The usual."

His stomach tightened with each lie, intestines twisting into the shape of Hebrew letters he couldn't read. On the muted TV, the subtitles scrolled: "[DRAMATIC PAUSE]" then "[SIGHS HEAVILY]" then "[FOOTSTEPS RETREATING]"—stage directions for his own life.

"That girl you mentioned? Rachel?"

"It didn't work out."

"Already? You have to give people a chance."

"We had nothing in common."

Like the thirty-three years he'd been searching for something neither of them could name.

"Speaking of dinner, Rosh Hashanah was last week. Rabbi Goldberg asked about you."

"That's nice."

"We barely had a minyan for Yom Kippur."

She said 'minyan' like it rhymed with 'onion.'

"I've been meaning to come visit."

"Your sister came with the kids. Rebecca thinks Henry might be gifted."

Rebecca, who'd married Brad, whose kids had stockings at Christmas and chocolate eggs at Easter.

"That's great."

"She asked about you."

Static crackled on the line, the connection wavering.

His phone showed 18% battery—always the same when his mother called.

"How's work?" His father's voice suddenly in stereo, probably having picked up the extension in his study, the room where he managed other people's money with spreadsheets that measured everything except what mattered.

"It's fine, Dad. User optimization."

"I still don't understand what you do."

"I help people buy things they don't need more efficiently."

His father cleared his throat.

Silence filled the line—three people breathing in different rooms. The Netflix screen flickered, pixels rearranging.

"I almost forgot. Tomorrow is your grandmother's yahrzeit."

She pronounced it 'yar-zite.'

"September 30th. It's been a year."

Through the wall—music suddenly louder.

"I should light a candle," his mother continued, uncertainty creeping in. "That's what you do, right? Light a candle?"

"I don't know, Mom."

"She would have known."

Through the wall, music swelled. The sound made his chest tighten.

"Do you ever think about her?"

"Sometimes."

"She loved you. She said you had an old soul."

"Don't be smart, Ethan Israel Stone."

The lights flickered on 'Israel.' On the screen, the frozen face shifted slightly.

"Sorry."

"Sorry. It's been a hard week. The news—Morocco, Libya, Israel. Always something with Israel."

Static surged on the word 'Israel.'

"Maybe that's why they named me after it," Ethan said. "A problem that won't go away."

"We named you after hope," his father said suddenly. Another throat clear. "We thought it meant you'd be a fighter."

"How's that working out?"

"You tell me."

Through the wall, the music stopped abruptly, mid-phrase. His apartment suddenly felt enormous and tiny simultaneously.

"We have some of Grandma's things in the attic. Books, photos. That blue vase from Jerusalem. Your father found them looking for tax documents."

The vase. Cobalt blue with a crack down one side that his grandmother said made it more beautiful.

"Do you want them?"

"Maybe."

"We love you," his mother said quickly.

"Love you too."

"Come visit soon."

"I will."

"And Ethan? Maybe think about lighting a candle for Grandma."

"Okay, Mom."

"I ordered one from Amazon. Two-day shipping."

Of course she did. Two-day shipping for a memorial.

The call ended at 7:36 PM. His battery had dropped to 10%.

He unmuted Netflix. The episode resumed, but the subtitles had glitched—different characters now, almost familiar. One word appeared repeatedly: "Teshuvah." His thumb hovered over Google, then withdrew.

One browser tab was still open to High Holiday services in Brooklyn, buried under other tabs.

From somewhere in the building, that music again. Words this time: "Shema Yisrael."

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Forgot to mention—Grandma's apartment was 613."

He stood and walked to his window. Brooklyn spread out below, lights beginning to pierce the darkness. Tomorrow was Friday. Then Saturday, the yahrzeit.

The Thai food sat congealed on his coffee table, untouched after that first bite. Through the wall, the music started again, softer this time. His skin prickled, goosebumps rising along his forearms.

His mother had ordered a yahrzeit candle from Amazon. It would arrive too late, which was perfect, which was exactly how the Stones did everything—with the best intentions, arriving just after the moment of meaning had passed, optimized for efficiency but never for presence.

The Netflix subtitles still showed that strange word: "Teshuvah." The man on screen was walking somewhere, the subtitles reading "[WALKING WITH PURPOSE]" in characters that seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them.

Ethan sat in his dark apartment, the only light from screens that measured his distance from life in percentages and pixels, waiting for something he couldn't name in a language he'd never learned from a grandmother whose yahrzeit candle would arrive two days too late from a company that could deliver everything except what mattered.

But in the attic in Westchester, in a box marked "Mom's Things" in his mother's careful handwriting, a blue vase with a crack down its side held nothing and everything, waiting like his grandmother's Hebrew books, like her photographs, like all the broken vessels that still held light, if only someone remembered how to look for it in the darkness.

The music through the wall whispered those words again—"Shema Yisrael."
The sound pressed against his eardrums from inside.
Tomorrow was the yahrzeit.
