# Chapter 4: Family Distance

His mother called three times before Ethan answered, and even then, he almost let it go to voicemail.

Thursday evening, September 28th, his apartment dark at 6:54 PM though autumn light still filtered through Brooklyn somewhere else, somewhere families gathered for dinners that meant something, the phone vibrating against the coffee table where he'd placed it face down after getting home from work, each buzz a small earthquake of obligation he couldn't escape, couldn't accept, could only let accumulate like voicemails from a life he wasn't living.

First call at 6:47—ignored while he microwaved leftover Thai food, the pad thai congealed into sweet-sick noodles, the microwave's hum drowning out the ringtone.

Second call at 6:51—watched the screen light up her contact photo from his cousin's wedding two years ago where everyone stood in formation, shoulders touching but hearts apart, smiles held for exactly three seconds, the precise duration of performed happiness.

Third call at 6:54—surrender.

"Hi, Mom."

"Finally! I was starting to worry. You know how I worry when you don't answer."

Netflix frozen mid-episode of Love is Blind, someone's face twisted in what the subtitles called "[ANGUISHED EXPRESSION]"—discovering betrayal in the pods, mouth forming words that looked exactly like what Ethan couldn't say. He left it paused, the frozen moment more honest than anything about to happen.

"Sorry, I was just—" The words caught. His mouth opened to say "drowning" but what came out was: "Working late."

"Always working. That's good, I suppose. Your father's here. David, it's Ethan!"

Through the phone: dishwasher hum, Anderson Cooper's voice dissecting catastrophe, ice against glass—his father's third scotch, that particular clink of Waterford crystal they'd received as a wedding gift, never used for wine on Friday nights, only for scotch during the news.

"How's Dad?"

"Oh, you know. Golf three times this week. His back's acting up but he won't admit it." A pause, her breathing slightly uneven. "How are you, honey? Really, how are you?"

The 'really' hung in the air like a door held open exactly three inches—enough to suggest entrance, not enough to actually enter.

"I'm good. Busy with work. The usual."

His stomach tightened with each lie, intestines twisting into the shape of Hebrew letters he couldn't read. On the muted TV, the subtitles scrolled: "[DRAMATIC PAUSE]" then "[SIGHS HEAVILY]" then "[FOOTSTEPS RETREATING]"—stage directions for his own life.

"And that girl you mentioned last week? Rachel?"

The name hit wrong. He'd forgotten he'd mentioned Rachel, the lie deployed to fill space like spackle over cracks. "Oh, that. It didn't work out."

"Already? Ethan, you have to give people a chance."

"I did give her a chance. We had dinner. We had nothing in common."

"Sometimes common ground takes time to find."

Like the thirty-three years he'd been searching for something neither of them could name, the number clicking in his mind—thirty-three, an age that meant something he couldn't place.

"Speaking of dinner," his mother's voice shifting to a different register, the one she used for topics that required navigation, "Rosh Hashanah was last week. Rabbi Goldberg asked about you. He always asks about you."

"That's nice of him."

"We barely had a minyan for Yom Kippur. Can you imagine? The High Holidays and we barely had ten men."

She said 'minyan' like it rhymed with 'onion,' the word catching slightly on her tongue.

"I've been meaning to come visit," he said, the words emerging in the same rhythm he'd used last week, last month, last year.

"Your sister came with the kids." Her voice caught slightly. "Rebecca thinks Henry might be gifted. He's only four but he's already reading."

Rebecca, who'd married Brad, whose kids had stockings at Christmas and chocolate eggs at Easter, who lived at 316 Maple Street—the number nagging at something in his mind.

"That's great."

"She asked about you."

Static crackled on the line, the connection wavering.

His phone showed 18% battery—chai, life draining, always the same percentage when his mother called, as if the universe had a sense of humor about his life force depleting during family contact.

"How's work?" His father's voice suddenly in stereo, probably having picked up the extension in his study, the room where he managed other people's money with spreadsheets that measured everything except what mattered.

"It's fine, Dad. Same project. User optimization."

"I still don't really understand what you do."

"I help people buy things they don't need more efficiently."

His father cleared his throat—that specific wet sound he made before changing subjects, the same sound before he'd announced the dog had to be put down, before saying Grandma was in the hospital.

Silence filled the line—three people breathing in different rooms. The Netflix screen flickered, pixels rearranging.

"Oh," his mother said suddenly, her voice brightening with the relief of remembering something practical, "I almost forgot. Tomorrow is your grandmother's yahrzeit."

She pronounced it 'yar-zite,' like a tourist reading a map of a country she'd never visit.

"Her what?"

"The anniversary of her death. September 30th. It's been a year."

Through the wall—music suddenly louder. Not just music, something pulling at memory like fingers through fog.

"I should light a candle," his mother continued, uncertainty creeping in. "That's what you do, right? Light a candle?"

"I don't know, Mom."

"She would have known."

Through the wall, music swelled—not just Hebrew, something older, the melody tickling at memory like a word on the tip of his tongue. The sound made his chest tighten, ribs contracting around something hollow.

"Do you ever think about her?" his mother asked, her voice suddenly younger.

"Sometimes." His thumb found the hang-up button, hovered there.

"She loved you, you know. She always said you had an old soul."

"All souls are old, Mom. That's kind of the point."

"Don't be smart with me, Ethan Israel Stone."

The lights flickered on 'Israel'—once, quick, like a blink. On the screen, the frozen face shifted slightly, a glitch in the stream.

"Sorry."

"No, I'm sorry. I'm just—it's been a hard week. The news is so depressing. Those poor people in Morocco. And the flooding in Libya. And God knows what's happening in Israel. It's always something with Israel."

Static surged on the word 'Israel,' the connection breaking up like the word itself was too heavy for the phone lines to carry.

"Maybe that's why they named me after it," Ethan said. "A problem that won't go away."

"We named you after hope," his father said suddenly. Another throat clear, wet and uncomfortable. "Israel means 'one who struggles with God.' We thought it meant you'd be a fighter."

"How's that working out?"

"You tell me."

Through the wall, the music stopped abruptly, mid-phrase. His apartment suddenly felt enormous and tiny simultaneously.

"We have some of Grandma's things," his mother said suddenly. "In the attic. Books in Hebrew. Photo albums. That blue vase she always kept on her mantel—you remember, the one she said came from Jerusalem? Your father found them last week when he was looking for tax documents."

The vase. Cobalt blue with a crack down one side that his grandmother said made it more beautiful, more real, more like life itself—broken but holding together, damaged but not destroyed.

"Do you want them?" she asked.

"I—" He almost said yes, almost said no, almost said 'I'm drowning and those might be the only things that could save me,' but what came out was: "Maybe."

"We love you," his mother said quickly, though the call had lasted—he checked—exactly 42 minutes.

"Love you too."

"Come visit soon."

"I will."

"And Ethan? Maybe think about lighting a candle for Grandma."

"Okay, Mom."

"I ordered one from Amazon. Two-day shipping."

Of course she did. Two-day shipping for a memorial.

The call ended at 7:36 PM—twice eighteen, double chai, double life, though Ethan only noticed his battery had dropped to exactly 10.55%, the decimal pointing to something precise he couldn't calculate.

He unmuted Netflix. The episode resumed, but the subtitles had glitched—different characters now, almost familiar. One word appeared repeatedly: "Teshuvah." His thumb hovered over Google, then withdrew.

His laptop showed Episode 3, Season 6. One browser tab was still open to High Holiday services in Brooklyn, buried under sixteen other tabs.

From somewhere in the building—above? below?—that music again. Words this time: "Shema Yisrael." The syllables pulled at something behind his sternum, a physical sensation like hunger but older, deeper.

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Forgot to mention—Grandma's apartment was 613. Funny how you remember random numbers."

The number lodged in his throat, a physical presence he couldn't swallow.

He stood and walked to his window. Brooklyn spread out below, lights beginning to pierce the darkness. Tomorrow was Friday. Then Saturday, the yahrzeit.

The Thai food sat congealed on his coffee table, untouched after that first bite. Through the wall, the music started again, softer this time. His skin prickled, goosebumps rising along his forearms.

His mother had ordered a yahrzeit candle from Amazon. It would arrive too late, which was perfect, which was exactly how the Stones did everything—with the best intentions, arriving just after the moment of meaning had passed, optimized for efficiency but never for presence.

The Netflix subtitles still showed that strange word: "Teshuvah." The man on screen was walking somewhere, the subtitles reading "[WALKING WITH PURPOSE]" in characters that seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them.

Ethan sat in his dark apartment, the only light from screens that measured his distance from life in percentages and pixels, waiting for something he couldn't name in a language he'd never learned from a grandmother whose yahrzeit candle would arrive two days too late from a company that could deliver everything except what mattered.

But in the attic in Westchester, in a box marked "Mom's Things" in his mother's careful handwriting, a blue vase with a crack down its side held nothing and everything, waiting like his grandmother's Hebrew books, like her photographs, like all the broken vessels that still held light, if only someone remembered how to look for it in the darkness.

The music through the wall whispered those words again—"Shema Yisrael."
The sound pressed against his eardrums from inside.
Tomorrow was the yahrzeit.
