# Chapter 4: Family Distance

His mother called three times before Ethan answered, and even then, he almost let it go to voicemail.

Thursday evening, September 28th, his apartment dark at 6:54 PM though autumn light still filtered through Brooklyn somewhere else, somewhere families gathered for dinners that meant something, the phone vibrating against the coffee table where he'd placed it face down after getting home from work, each buzz a small earthquake of obligation he couldn't escape, couldn't accept, could only let accumulate like voicemails from a life he wasn't living.

First call at 6:47—ignored while he microwaved leftover Thai food that had been leftover for three days, the pad thai congealed into sweet-sick noodles that smelled like sugar gone wrong, like promises past their expiration date.

Second call at 6:51—watched the screen light up her contact photo from his cousin's wedding two years ago where everyone stood in formation, shoulders touching but hearts apart, smiles held for exactly three seconds, the precise duration of performed happiness.

Third call at 6:54—surrender.

"Hi, Mom."

"Finally! I was starting to worry. You know how I worry when you don't answer."

Netflix frozen mid-episode on someone's face twisted in what the subtitles called "[ANGUISHED EXPRESSION]"—a man discovering his wife's betrayal, mouth open in a silent scream that looked exactly how Ethan felt but couldn't express. He left it paused, the frozen anguish more honest than anything he was about to say.

"Sorry, I was just—" The words caught. His mouth opened to say "drowning" but what came out was: "Working late."

"Always working. That's good, I suppose. Your father's here. David, it's Ethan!"

Through the phone: dishwasher hum, CNN's apocalypse-of-the-day in the background, ice clinking against glass—his father's third scotch, the sound Ethan knew from childhood, the rhythm of his father's emotional distance measured in crystal and amber.

"How's Dad?"

"Oh, you know. Golf three times this week. His back's acting up but he won't admit it. Men and their pride. How are you, honey? Really, how are you?"

The 'really' hung in the air like a door held open exactly three inches—enough to suggest entrance, not enough to actually enter.

"I'm good. Busy with work. The usual."

His stomach tightened with each lie, intestines twisting into the shape of Hebrew letters he couldn't read. On the muted TV, the subtitles scrolled: "[DRAMATIC PAUSE]" then "[SIGHS HEAVILY]" then "[FOOTSTEPS RETREATING]"—stage directions for his own life.

"And that girl you mentioned last week? Rachel?"

The name hit wrong. He'd forgotten he'd mentioned Rachel, the lie deployed to fill space like spackle over cracks. "Oh, that. It didn't work out."

"Already? Ethan, you have to give people a chance."

"I did give her a chance. We had dinner. We had nothing in common."

"Sometimes common ground takes time to find."

Like the thirty-three years he'd been trying to find common ground with his parents, the number clicking in his mind—thirty-three, age of transformation, age of crucifixion, age of nothing changing.

"Speaking of dinner," his mother's voice shifting to a different register, the one she used for topics that required navigation, "Rosh Hashanah was last week. Rabbi Goldberg asked about you. He always asks about you."

"That's nice of him."

"We barely had a minyan for Yom Kippur. Can you imagine? The High Holidays and we barely had ten men."

She said 'minyan' like it rhymed with 'onion,' the word foreign in her mouth despite being her birthright, her inheritance, her loss.

"I've been meaning to come visit," he said, the words emerging in the same rhythm he'd used last week, last month, last year.

"Your sister came with the kids. They're getting so big. Rebecca thinks Henry might be gifted. He's only four but he's already reading."

Rebecca, who'd married a Methodist named Brad, who lived at 316 Maple Street—half of 613, half the commandments, half the connection, everything in their family always half of what it should be.

"That's great."

"She asked about you. Everyone asks about you."

Static crackled on the line when she said 'everyone,' the connection wavering like faith, like memory, like the sound of distance multiplied by silence.

His phone showed 18% battery—chai, life draining, always the same percentage when his mother called, as if the universe had a sense of humor about his life force depleting during family contact.

"How's work?" His father's voice suddenly in stereo, probably having picked up the extension in his study, the room where he managed other people's money with spreadsheets that measured everything except what mattered.

"It's fine, Dad. Same project. User optimization."

"I still don't really understand what you do."

"I help people buy things they don't need more efficiently."

"That's a bit cynical, isn't it?" His mother's voice pitched higher, concern masked as observation.

"It's accurate."

Silence filled the line—not empty silence but the kind full of unspoken diagnoses, swallowed concerns, the sound of three people breathing in different rooms of different buildings in different versions of the same loneliness. The Netflix screen flickered, the frozen man's anguish shifting slightly, a glitch that made him look like he was trying to escape the frame.

"Oh," his mother said suddenly, her voice brightening with the relief of remembering something practical, "I almost forgot. Tomorrow is your grandmother's yahrzeit."

She pronounced it 'yar-zite,' like a tourist reading a map of a country she'd never visit.

"Her what?"

"The anniversary of her death. September 30th. It's been a year."

The music through the wall suddenly louder—definitely Hebrew, the melody his grandmother hummed while cooking, while cleaning, while dying, though he'd forgotten he knew it until now.

"I should light a candle," his mother continued, uncertainty creeping in. "That's what you do, right? Light a candle?"

"I don't know, Mom."

"She would have known. She knew all that stuff. The prayers, the traditions. We should have paid more attention."

Should have. The family motto. Should have stayed closer. Should have moved farther. Should have been anything other than what they were—successful, assimilated, and spiritually starving. Through the wall, the Hebrew music reached a crescendo just as his mother said "traditions," as if the universe was providing a soundtrack to their loss.

"Do you ever think about her?" his mother asked, her voice suddenly younger, uncertain.

"Sometimes." His thumb found the hang-up button, hovered there like a blessing or a curse.

"She loved you, you know. You were her favorite. She always said you had an old soul."

"All souls are old, Mom. That's kind of the point."

"Don't be smart with me, Ethan Israel Stone."

The full name activated something—the lights in his apartment flickered when she said 'Israel,' just once, so quick he might have imagined it. The man on the Netflix screen seemed to turn slightly toward him.

"Sorry."

"No, I'm sorry. I'm just—it's been a hard week. The news is so depressing. Those poor people in Morocco. And the flooding in Libya. And God knows what's happening in Israel. It's always something with Israel."

Static surged on the word 'Israel,' the connection breaking up like the word itself was too heavy for the phone lines to carry.

"Maybe that's why they named me after it," Ethan said. "A problem that won't go away."

"We named you after hope," his father said suddenly, clearing his throat. "Israel means 'one who struggles with God.' We thought—your mother and I thought—it meant you'd be a fighter. Someone who wouldn't just accept things."

"How's that working out?"

"You tell me."

Through the wall, the Hebrew music stopped abruptly, mid-phrase, leaving a silence that felt louder than sound. Ethan's apartment suddenly felt enormous and tiny simultaneously, like those paradoxes his grandmother used to talk about—the infinite contained in the finite, the divine hidden in the ordinary, God in the details no one bothered to examine.

"We have some of Grandma's things," his mother said suddenly. "In the attic. Books in Hebrew. Photo albums. That blue vase she always kept on her mantel—you remember, the one she said came from Jerusalem? Your father found them last week when he was looking for tax documents."

The vase. Cobalt blue with a crack down one side that his grandmother said made it more beautiful, more real, more like life itself—broken but holding together, damaged but not destroyed.

"Do you want them?" she asked.

"I—" He almost said yes, almost said no, almost said 'I'm drowning and those might be the only things that could save me,' but what came out was: "Maybe."

"We love you," his mother said quickly, like she was running out of time, though the call had only lasted—he checked—exactly 42 minutes. Forty-two, the number of journeys in the wilderness, though he didn't know that, couldn't know that, refused to know that.

"Love you too."

"Come visit soon. Really visit, not just for an afternoon."

"I will." The same rhythm as before, the same lie in the same key.

"And Ethan? Maybe think about lighting a candle for Grandma. I don't know the prayers or anything, but maybe just... light a candle."

"Okay, Mom."

"I ordered one from Amazon. Two-day shipping."

Of course she did. Even grief had been optimized, memorial reduced to Prime delivery, tradition commodified into something that could be tracked with a number.

The call ended at 7:36 PM—twice eighteen, double chai, double life, though Ethan only noticed his battery had dropped to exactly 10.55%, the decimal pointing to something precise he couldn't calculate.

He unmuted Netflix. The episode resumed, but something had glitched—the subtitles were now in a different language. Hebrew? No, but something that looked almost familiar. One word appeared repeatedly: "Teshuvah." He grabbed his phone to Google it but stopped. Some things were meant to be unknown until they weren't.

His laptop showed Episode 3, Season 6—three times six, eighteen again, chai following him through every screen. One browser tab was still open to High Holiday services in Brooklyn, buried under sixteen other tabs like a body under fallen leaves.

From somewhere in the building—above? below? through dimensions?—that music again. This time he caught actual words: "Shema Yisrael." He didn't know it meant "Hear, O Israel," didn't know it was calling his hidden name, didn't know his grandmother had whispered it every night before sleep and every morning upon waking, bookending her days with listening.

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Forgot to mention—Grandma's apartment was 613. Funny how you remember random numbers."

Six thirteen. The number hummed in his mind like a frequency he couldn't quite tune into, a station broadcasting something essential in static he'd been trained not to hear.

He stood and walked to his window. Brooklyn spread out below, lights beginning to pierce the darkness—menorahs and TVs, Shabbat candles and smartphones, all the illuminations of a Friday night he wasn't participating in. Tomorrow was Friday. Then Saturday, the yahrzeit, the time of year, the time of forgetting, the time of remembering what you'd forgotten to forget.

The Thai food sat congealed on his coffee table, untouched after that first bite, a $18 mistake—chai again, that number stalking him through everything. Through the wall, the music started again, softer this time, like a lullaby, like his grandmother's voice when he was young and she was alive and everything broken could still be made whole.

His mother had ordered a yahrzeit candle from Amazon. It would arrive too late, which was perfect, which was exactly how the Stones did everything—with the best intentions, arriving just after the moment of meaning had passed, optimized for efficiency but never for presence.

The Netflix subtitles still showed that strange word: "Teshuvah." Return, though he didn't know that yet. The man on screen was no longer anguished—he was walking somewhere, the subtitles reading "[WALKING WITH PURPOSE]" though they were still in that almost-Hebrew script.

Ethan sat in his dark apartment, the only light from screens that measured his distance from life in percentages and pixels, waiting for something he couldn't name in a language he'd never learned from a grandmother whose yahrzeit candle would arrive two days too late from a company that could deliver everything except what mattered.

But in the attic in Westchester, in a box marked "Mom's Things" in his mother's careful handwriting, a blue vase with a crack down its side held nothing and everything, waiting like his grandmother's Hebrew books, like her photographs, like all the broken vessels that still held light, if only someone remembered how to look for it in the darkness.

The music through the wall whispered "Shema Yisrael" again.
Hear, O Israel.
But Israel wasn't listening.
Not yet.
Not tonight.
But tomorrow was the yahrzeit, and even Amazon couldn't optimize away the weight of memory forever.
