# Chapter 4: Family Distance

His mother called three times before Ethan answered, and even then, he almost let it go to voicemail.

Thursday evening, September 28th, his apartment already dark though it was only 7:18 PM—chai reversed, life backwards, everything backwards including this weekly performance of familial connection that connected nothing. The phone vibrated against the coffee table where he'd placed it face down after getting home from work, each buzz a small earthquake of obligation he couldn't escape.

First call: ignored while he microwaved leftover Thai food that had been leftover for three days.

Second call: watched the screen light up her contact photo—a picture from his cousin's wedding two years ago where everyone looked happy in that specific way families look happy in photos, arranged and artificial, smiles held just long enough for the camera to capture what wasn't really there.

Third call: surrender.

"Hi, Mom."

"Finally! I was starting to worry. You know how I worry when you don't answer."

Netflix paused mid-episode of something he'd been watching without watching, the frozen frame showing two people in conversation that looked more real than the one he was about to have. He left it on, muted, the subtitles continuing to scroll across the bottom like the conversation he wished he was having instead.

"Sorry, I was just—" He stopped. Was just what? Avoiding this? Sitting in darkness eating three-day-old pad thai? Scrolling through dating apps without swiping on anyone? "Working late."

"Always working. That's good, I suppose. Your father's here. David, it's Ethan!"

Background sounds: his father's voice from another room, probably his study where he managed other people's money with the same careful distance he managed his family's emotions. The clink of dishes—his mother always called while cleaning up from dinner, multitasking connection like everything else could be optimized.

"How's Dad?"

"Oh, you know. Golf three times this week. His back's acting up but he won't admit it. Men and their pride. How are you, honey? Really, how are you?"

The 'really' was emphasis, not invitation. She wanted him to be fine, needed him to be fine, had constructed an entire worldview around everyone being fine.

"I'm good. Busy with work. The usual."

"And that girl you mentioned last week? Rachel?"

He'd forgotten he'd mentioned Rachel, the lie told to fill space, to give his mother something to hold onto that wasn't his emptiness. "Oh, that. It didn't work out."

"Already? Ethan, you have to give people a chance."

"I did give her a chance. We had dinner. We had nothing in common."

"Sometimes common ground takes time to find."

Like the thirty-two years he'd been trying to find common ground with his parents, he didn't say. On the muted TV, the subtitles read "[EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING]" which seemed about right.

"Speaking of dinner," his mother continued, her segue voice activating, "Rosh Hashanah was last week. Rabbi Goldberg asked about you. He always asks about you."

"That's nice of him."

"We barely had a minyan for Yom Kippur. Can you imagine? The High Holidays and we barely had ten men."

The High Holidays. She said it like she was saying 'the thing,' like the words were foreign in her mouth despite being her birthright. They belonged to Temple Beth Shalom exactly twice a year, their Judaism a biannual subscription they maintained out of guilt rather than faith.

"I've been meaning to come visit," Ethan said, the lie automatic, practiced.

"Your sister came with the kids. They're getting so big. Rebecca thinks Henry might be gifted. He's only four but he's already reading."

Rebecca, who'd married a Methodist named Brad, whose kids were being raised 'spiritual but not religious,' whatever that meant. Rebecca, who'd found her escape velocity while Ethan remained in orbit, circling the same empty space.

"That's great."

"She asked about you. Everyone asks about you."

Everyone asks but no one really wants to know, he thought. His phone showed 18% battery again—chai, life, always draining at the same rate, always the same number following him like a cosmic joke he wasn't in on.

"How's work?" His father's voice suddenly closer, probably having wandered in from his study, drawn by the gravitational pull of small talk.

"It's fine, Dad. Same project. User optimization."

"I still don't really understand what you do."

"I help people buy things they don't need more efficiently."

"That's a bit cynical, isn't it?" His mother's voice carried that particular tone of liberal concern, worried but not enough to actually probe deeper.

"It's accurate."

Silence. The kind of silence families specialized in, full of everything unsaid. On the TV, the scene had changed—now someone was crying, subtitles reading "[SNIFFLING]" like stage directions for emotions none of them knew how to perform anymore.

"Oh," his mother said suddenly, "I almost forgot. Tomorrow is your grandmother's yahrzeit."

The word landed wrong, like she'd pronounced it 'yar-zite' instead of 'yahrzeit,' like she was reading it phonetically from a Judaism for Dummies book.

"Her what?"

"The anniversary of her death. September 30th. It's been a year."

A year. His grandmother, Rivka Stone, whose Hebrew name his mother could barely pronounce, whose stories had been buried with her, whose faith had been something the family treated like a genetic condition they'd successfully avoided passing on.

"I should light a candle," his mother continued. "That's what you do, right? Light a candle?"

"I don't know, Mom."

"She would have known. She knew all that stuff. The prayers, the traditions. We should have paid more attention."

Should have. The family motto. Should have stayed closer to tradition. Should have moved farther from it. Should have been something other than what they were—Jews who weren't Jewish, Americans who weren't quite American, a family suspended between identities like those particles that existed in multiple states until observed, except no one was observing them, least of all themselves.

"Do you ever think about her?" his mother asked, and for a moment her voice sounded different, younger, like she was a daughter again instead of a mother.

"Sometimes."

"She loved you, you know. You were her favorite. She always said you had an old soul."

"All souls are old, Mom. That's kind of the point."

"Don't be smart with me, Ethan Israel Stone."

The full name. She only used it when frustrated, not knowing she was invoking something she didn't understand—Ethan, the strong one; Israel, the one who wrestles with God; Stone, what they'd all become.

"Sorry."

"No, I'm sorry. I'm just—it's been a hard week. The news is so depressing. Those poor people in Morocco. And the flooding in Libya. And God knows what's happening in Israel. It's always something with Israel."

Israel. She said it like a problem relative, the cousin who kept asking for money, the family member you had to acknowledge but wished you didn't.

"Maybe that's why they named me after it," Ethan said. "A problem that won't go away."

"We named you after hope," his father said suddenly, his voice carrying an unexpected weight. "Israel means 'one who struggles with God.' We thought—your mother and I thought—it meant you'd be a fighter. Someone who wouldn't just accept things."

"How's that working out?"

"You tell me."

More silence. Outside, through his window, he could hear someone playing music—Hebrew, maybe, or Arabic, he couldn't tell the difference. The melody was mournful, ancient, like something that had been sung for thousands of years and would be sung for thousands more, long after the Stones had forgotten they were ever anything but stones.

"We love you," his mother said finally, the words rushed like she was running out of time, though they had nothing but time, endless Thursday night phone calls stretching into the future, the same conversation repeated with minor variations, a liturgy of avoidance.

"Love you too."

"Come visit soon. Really visit, not just for an afternoon."

"I will."

"And Ethan? Maybe think about lighting a candle for Grandma. I don't know the prayers or anything, but maybe just... light a candle."

"Okay, Mom."

"Okay. Well. Your father wants to watch his show."

"Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad."

"Goodbye, son."

The call ended at exactly 8:00 PM, forty-two minutes of connection that connected nothing, love expressed but not felt, family performed but not experienced. Ethan set the phone down, noticed it was at 13% battery now—still falling, still failing, everything still draining away.

He unmuted Netflix. The show resumed, people talking about nothing in particular, lives that looked meaningful in twenty-two-minute increments with commercial breaks where the real emptiness lived. His Thai food had congealed into something unrecognizable, like his own life maybe, once hot and promising, now cold and formless.

His laptop sat open on the coffee table, seventeen browser tabs open to articles he'd never finish reading. One was about High Holiday services in Brooklyn. He'd opened it after his mother mentioned Rosh Hashanah, then immediately opened sixteen other tabs to bury it, to avoid looking at what he was avoiding looking at.

From somewhere in the building, that music again—definitely Hebrew now, he could make out words that sounded like "Shema" though he didn't know what they meant, only that his grandmother used to say them, covering her eyes with her hands like she was hiding from something or maybe looking for something that could only be seen with eyes closed.

His phone buzzed. A text from his mother: "Forgot to mention—found some of Grandma's things in the attic. Photos, some books in Hebrew. Do you want them?"

He stared at the message. Somewhere in Westchester, in a house with a mezuzah they never touched, in an attic full of things they'd rather forget, pieces of his grandmother waited like seeds that might still grow if anyone remembered how to tend them.

"Sure," he texted back. Then, after a moment: "What's yahrzeit mean exactly?"

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again. Finally: "I looked it up. It means 'time of year' in Yiddish. You light a candle that burns for 24 hours. I ordered one from Amazon. Two-day shipping."

Of course she did. Even memorial had been optimized, grief made efficient, tradition reduced to two-day shipping and one-click ordering.

He closed his eyes and tried to remember his grandmother's face, but all he could see was the contact photo from his mother's call—everyone arranged, everyone smiling, everyone pretending they were more connected than they were. Through the wall, the Hebrew music continued, rising and falling like breath, like prayer, like something that knew how to mourn properly, how to remember properly, how to be properly Jewish instead of whatever the Stones were—successful, assimilated, and absolutely lost.

The day after tomorrow was Saturday, September 30th, the yahrzeit, the time of year, the anniversary of the last person in their family who actually knew what that meant. He should light a candle. His mother had ordered one from Amazon. It would arrive in two days, which would be too late, which was perfect, which was exactly how the Stones did everything—with the best intentions, arriving just after the moment had passed.

The music through the wall stopped abruptly, mid-phrase, like someone had suddenly remembered they weren't supposed to be playing it, weren't supposed to be feeling it, weren't supposed to be Jewish in a way that made sound, that took up space, that refused to assimilate into silence.

Ethan sat in his dark apartment, Netflix auto-playing the next episode of nothing, battery draining toward zero, waiting for something he couldn't name, wouldn't name, had never been taught the words to name. But tomorrow was the yahrzeit. And somewhere in Westchester, in an attic, his grandmother's Hebrew books waited like a message in a language he'd never learned but might somehow, impossibly, still remember.

The time of year. Time to remember. Time to forget. Time to be exactly what they'd always been—Jews without Judaism, family without connection, stones that had forgotten they were ever meant to be anything but stones, except for that one voice through the wall singing in Hebrew, except for that word yahrzeit his mother couldn't pronounce, except for that name Israel hidden in the middle of his own name like a seed, like a secret, like a struggle with God he didn't believe in but couldn't stop wrestling with anyway.
