# Chapter 13: Streets of Argument

The protest signs read "Never Again" on one side of Columbus Circle and "Free Palestine" on the other, competing slogans forming a geometry of irreconcilable truths.

Saturday, October 21st. Two weeks since the vigil at Washington Square, but it felt like years.

He'd come to observe. That's what he told himself walking from the subway. But the competing sounds drew him in—two crowds at opposite ends of Columbus Circle, police barriers between them, the air thick with October cold and something else. Rage, maybe. Or fear dressed up as righteousness.

The chants hit him from blocks away—"Never Again" colliding with "Free Palestine," the words tangling into something that made his teeth ache. Police everywhere, horses, barriers, news vans. The smell of hot dogs from a cart mixed with the metallic tang of tension, the anticipation of violence everyone felt coming.

The pro-Israel demonstration filled the eastern curve. Blue and white flags rippling like prayer shawls in the wind. "Bring Them Home" banners with faces of hostages—real faces, real names. A woman held a photo of her nephew, twenty-three, taken from the music festival. Her hand shook. Small details that broke through the noise: trembling fingers, tears cutting tracks through makeup, the way she kept touching the photo like it might dissolve.

He recognized her immediately—Rachel from synagogue (not the date), from the Shabbat services he'd been attending for two weeks now, from careful conversations over wine and challah where everyone talked around the horror without naming it directly.

She held a sign in Hebrew he couldn't read. Dark circles under her eyes, her voice hoarse from chanting or crying or both. When she saw him, something shifted in her expression—relief, maybe, at seeing another familiar face in the chaos.

"Am Yisrael Chai"—the people of Israel live. The crowd held contradictions: an older Jewish man nearby wore both a kippah and a Palestinian solidarity pin. The sight made Ethan's head spin.

Rachel caught his stare, turned away with a tight jaw.

He walked the perimeter, caught between worlds. The police barriers felt both protective and divisive—keeping the crowds apart but also keeping something else separate. Understanding, maybe. Or the possibility of it.

The Palestinian solidarity side: younger, louder, more diverse. A mix of students, activists, families. A Palestinian woman held her daughter's hand, maybe seven years old, wearing a small keffiyeh. The girl's sign read "I Want To See My Grandma in Gaza." Simple. Devastating. True.

Near them, white kids from Columbia chanted "From the River to the Sea." The Palestinian mother winced at their volume, pulled her daughter closer. There were layers here Ethan hadn't expected—not everyone on the same side wanted the same thing, or wanted it the same way.

That's when he saw Aaron.

His best friend since freshman year at NYU, his roommate through law school applications, through breakups, through his grandmother's death when Aaron had sat shiva with him despite Ethan not knowing that's what they were doing. Aaron who'd become a civil rights lawyer, who defended immigrants, who quoted James Baldwin and Abraham Joshua Heschel with equal reverence.

Aaron wearing a keffiyeh.

The same Aaron who'd gone with him to that first protest—Occupy Wall Street, 2011, both of them twenty-two and certain they could change everything. "We're on the right side of history," Aaron had said then, arm around Ethan's shoulder, both of them drunk on possibility. They'd gotten arrested together that night, called Ethan's grandmother from jail because Aaron's parents would have killed him. She'd brought them soup the next day.

"From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free."

The chant rose as their eyes met—eighteen years of friendship compressed into three seconds of recognition, evaluation, loss.

"Ethan! Thank God. I've been texting you for days."

The embrace automatic, muscle memory from eighteen years of friendship, though the keffiyeh against his cheek felt like betrayal, like costume—Aaron playing at revolution with other people's symbols, other people's struggle, pain he'd adopted because it fit his narrative of justice, of righteousness, of being on the right side of history.

"This is incredible, right?" Aaron's voice carried forced enthusiasm.

"Aaron—"

"We're witnessing genocide, Ethan. The whole world is finally waking up."

A woman near them, hijabi, Palestinian flag draped over her shoulders, glanced at Aaron with something like exhaustion. "Please," she said quietly, "this isn't about waking up. My family has been awake for seventy years."

Aaron flushed, adjusted his keffiyeh.

"It's complex—"

Aaron's voice went raw. "They're murdering children, Ethan."

"I know. I saw the videos from Gaza. I also saw—" Ethan's voice cracked. "The babies from the kibbutz."

"That's different—"

"How? Tell me how dead children are different."

The Palestinian woman from earlier moved closer, her daughter now on her hip. "Please," she said to both of them. "My cousin was at that music festival. She was a peace activist. She taught Arabic to Israeli children." Her voice broke. "Hamas killed her too. But her death doesn't justify—" She gestured helplessly at her daughter. "This one asks for her aunt every day."

Aaron's face went white. The woman walked away before either of them could respond.

"I didn't know," Aaron said quietly.

"There's a lot we don't know." Ethan felt exhausted. "October 7th—"

"Don't." Aaron's walls went back up. "One tragedy doesn't excuse—"

"I'm not excusing anything." Ethan looked at his oldest friend, seeing a stranger in a keffiyeh. "When did we stop being able to hold two truths?"

"When one truth means ignoring genocide."

"Or when the other means ignoring massacres."

They stood there, eighteen years of friendship fracturing in real time. Behind Aaron, the CNN ticker showed the death toll climbing on both sides.

"You've gone full Zionist," Aaron said, but it sounded more like a question.

"I don't even know what that word means anymore. Does it mean I think Jews deserve a homeland? That my cousins in Tel Aviv deserve to live? Or supporting every settlement, every—"

"It means choosing tribe over justice."

Ethan stepped closer. "And what does Palestine mean to you? Justice or just another way to hate yourself?"

Aaron flushed. "My grandmother survived—"

"Mine too." Ethan's voice turned hard. "But I'm done apologizing for taking up space in my own story."

They stared at each other across the divide. Ethan remembered Aaron crying in his dorm room junior year, reading about Darfur. "How do we just watch?" Aaron had asked. "How do we live normal lives while this happens?"

Now Aaron was watching Gaza. Ethan was watching Aaron.

"Remember what you said about Darfur?" Ethan asked quietly. "About how we couldn't just watch?"

Aaron's face cracked. "This is different."

"No," Ethan said. "It's exactly the same. Except now you think you have to choose sides to stop watching."

A bottle flew—glass shattering against police shields. Then the surge: bodies pressing forward from both sides, horses rearing, batons out. The smell of pepper spray cut through everything.

"MOVE BACK! MOVE BACK!"

Someone shoved Ethan hard from behind. He stumbled forward, catching himself against Aaron, who grabbed his arm instinctively—muscle memory of friendship overriding everything else. For a second they were just two scared kids from NYU again, holding each other up in the chaos.

The crowd compressed, bodies pressing from all directions. Ethan couldn't breathe, couldn't move. A woman in a hijab fell beside him; he pulled her up without thinking. She gripped his hand hard, terror universal across any divide. Someone was screaming in Hebrew. Someone else in Arabic. The same panic in different languages.

"ARE YOU A ZIONIST?"

A young activist, maybe nineteen, phone out, hunting for content. 

"I'm a human being watching other human beings suffer," Ethan said.

"That's not an answer."

Ethan looked past the phone, directly at the kid. "It's the only answer that matters."

The activist moved on to easier targets. But the Palestinian mother from earlier caught Ethan's eye, gave him the slightest nod. Not agreement. Just recognition that nothing here was simple.

"Ethan!"

Rachel's voice, her hand on his arm, pulling him away from the chaos. But this time, Ethan stopped. Pulled back.

"No," he said. "I'm not running."

He looked across the divide at Aaron, still wrapped in his keffiyeh, still certain. Then at Rachel, exhausted and torn. Then at the Palestinian mother, walking away with her daughter.

"Your people need you," Rachel said, but her voice was uncertain.

"Which people?" 

Rachel looked exhausted. "My brother's in the IDF. My cousin works for B'Tselem. Family dinners are impossible. We're all Jews. We all want to survive. We just can't agree what that means."

She paused. "The ones asking the same question—those are your people."

She left him there, returning to her sign, her vigil, her stubborn insistence on continuing despite everything.

Ethan walked away, the protests still audible behind him. By the reservoir, a Jewish father taught his son to skip stones while wearing a "Ceasefire Now" button. Life continuing.

Something was crystallizing. Maybe it had started with seeing Aaron in the keffiyeh. Maybe with the Palestinian mother's story. Maybe just from standing between two crowds and refusing to choose a corner.

He might book a flight to Tel Aviv. Or he might not. But he wouldn't decide from here, from this distance, from this American safety.

His phone buzzed with texts:

Aaron: "We need to talk. That woman, what she said..."

Rachel: "I'm sorry about your friend. This is destroying everyone."

His mother: "Saw the news about Columbus Circle. Please tell me you're safe."

He answered only his mother: "I'm safe. Nothing here is."

He sat by the water. Ducks swam past, indifferent to human conflict.

His grandmother would have understood this—crowds turning against complexity. But she would have known something else: sometimes you had to choose not because you were certain but because choosing was the only way to honor the dead.

Walking home across the bridge at sunset, Brooklyn ahead. But different now. The decision already made.

That night, Ethan opened his laptop to book the flight. El Al had seats available. Of course they did.

His phone lit with a message from Aaron:

"I keep thinking about that woman. Her cousin. Remember when we went to that Darfur protest junior year? You said 'bearing witness isn't enough but sometimes it's all we have.' I thought that was bullshit then. Now... My grandfather used to say 'In the camps, we learned that sometimes survival itself is resistance.' I don't know what to do with that."

Then:

"If you go to Israel, tell me what you see. Not what you're supposed to see. What you actually see." 

Ethan typed back: "I already booked the flight."

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again.

"Be careful. Not just physically. Don't let it make you hard."

"Don't let it make you simple," Ethan replied.

A long pause. Then:

"Still brothers?"

"Different sides of the same argument."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer we have."

The conversation ended there. Everything that mattered between them suspended in digital space, waiting for resolution that might never come.

Ethan confirmed his flight. November 4th. Tel Aviv.

Outside, sirens wailed through Brooklyn. The protests would continue tomorrow. The crowds would gather. The chants would rise.

But Ethan would be gone, flying toward the thing itself rather than its representations, toward the place where his middle name meant something beyond metaphor.

The space between crowds was shrinking.

He would go stand in it anyway.
