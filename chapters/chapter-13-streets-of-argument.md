# Chapter 13: Streets of Argument

The protest signs read "Never Again" on one side of Columbus Circle and "Free Palestine" on the other, competing slogans forming a geometry of irreconcilable truths.

Saturday, October 21st. Two weeks since the vigil at Washington Square, but it felt like years.

He'd come to observe. That's what he told himself walking from the subway. But the competing sounds drew him in—two crowds at opposite ends of Columbus Circle, police barriers between them, the air thick with October cold and something else. Rage, maybe. Or fear dressed up as righteousness.

The chants hit him from blocks away—"Never Again" colliding with "Free Palestine," the words tangling into something that made his teeth ache. Police everywhere, horses, barriers, news vans. The smell of hot dogs from a cart mixed with the metallic tang of tension, the anticipation of violence everyone felt coming.

The pro-Israel demonstration filled the eastern curve. Blue and white flags rippling like prayer shawls in the wind. "Bring Them Home" banners with faces of hostages—real faces, real names. A woman held a photo of her nephew, twenty-three, taken from the music festival. Her hand shook. Small details that broke through the noise: trembling fingers, tears cutting tracks through makeup, the way she kept touching the photo like it might dissolve.

"Am Yisrael Chai"—the people of Israel live. The crowd held contradictions: an older Jewish man nearby wore both a kippah and a Palestinian solidarity pin. The sight made Ethan's head spin.

He walked the perimeter, caught between worlds. The police barriers felt both protective and divisive—keeping the crowds apart but also keeping something else separate. Understanding, maybe. Or the possibility of it.

The Palestinian solidarity side: younger, louder, more diverse. A mix of students, activists, families. A Palestinian woman held her daughter's hand, maybe seven years old, wearing a small keffiyeh. The girl's sign read "I Want To See My Grandma in Gaza." Simple. Devastating. True.

Near them, white kids from Columbia chanted "From the River to the Sea." The Palestinian mother winced at their volume, pulled her daughter closer. There were layers here Ethan hadn't expected—not everyone on the same side wanted the same thing, or wanted it the same way.

That's when he saw Aaron.

His best friend since NYU—roommate through applications and breakups, the one who'd sat shiva with him even when Ethan didn’t know the word for it. Now a civil rights lawyer who defended immigrants, who quoted Baldwin and Heschel with equal reverence.

Aaron wearing a keffiyeh.

The same Aaron who'd gone with him to Occupy Wall Street in 2011—both twenty-two, certain they could change everything. Arrested together. Calling Ethan's grandmother from the precinct. She brought soup the next day.

"From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free."

The chant rose as their eyes met—nearly twenty years of friendship compressed into three seconds of recognition, evaluation, loss.

"Ethan! I've been texting you for days."

The embrace automatic. The keffiyeh against his cheek felt like costume anyway.

"This is… a lot," Aaron said, voice too bright.

"Aaron—"

"Jesus, Ethan. The footage from Gaza—"

"I know." Ethan's voice cracked. "The kibbutz too. Those babies—"

"That's different."

"How?" The word came out sharper than he meant. "Aaron, we used to talk about this stuff. Remember freshman year? You said moral complexity was just cowardice dressed up."

"This isn't complex. It's apartheid."

"Since when do you wear keffiyehs to protests?" 

The Palestinian woman from earlier moved closer, her daughter on her hip. "Please," she said to both of them. "My cousin was at that music festival. A peace activist." Her voice broke. "Hamas killed her too. But her death doesn't justify—" She gestured at her daughter. "This one asks for her aunt every day."

Aaron's face went white. The woman walked away before either of them could respond.

"I didn't know," Aaron said quietly.

"There's a lot we don't know." Ethan felt exhausted. "October 7th—"

"Don't." Aaron's walls went back up. "One tragedy doesn't excuse—"

"I'm not excusing anything." Ethan looked at his oldest friend, seeing a stranger in a keffiyeh. "When did we stop being able to hold two truths?"

"When one truth means ignoring genocide."

"Or when the other means ignoring massacres."

They stood there, nearly twenty years of friendship fracturing in real time. Behind Aaron, the CNN ticker showed the death toll climbing on both sides.

"You've gone full Zionist," Aaron said, but it sounded more like a question.

"Have I? Or have you just decided that questioning Hamas makes me the enemy?"

Aaron's jaw tightened. "Since when do you care about any of this?"

"Since October 7th. Since watching you post about genocide while I'm sitting shiva for people I've never met but somehow—" Ethan stopped. "Forget it."

"No, say it."

"Since I realized that watching my best friend celebrate Jewish deaths feels different than I thought it would."

Aaron went white. "I never—"

"You shared that video from the paraglider. With the heart emoji."

"I didn't know what it was."

"Yes, you did."

They stared at each other across the divide. Ethan remembered Aaron crying in his dorm room junior year, reading about Darfur. "How do we just watch?" Aaron had asked. "How do we live normal lives while this happens?"

Now Aaron was watching Gaza. Ethan was watching Aaron.

"Remember what you said about Darfur?" Ethan asked quietly. "About how we couldn't just watch?"

Aaron's face cracked. "This is different."

"No," Ethan said. "It's exactly the same. Except now you think you have to choose sides to stop watching."

A bottle flew—glass shattering against police shields. Then the surge: bodies pressing forward from both sides, horses rearing, batons out. The smell of pepper spray cut through everything.

"MOVE BACK! MOVE BACK!"

Someone shoved Ethan hard from behind. He stumbled forward, catching himself against Aaron, who grabbed his arm instinctively—muscle memory of friendship overriding everything else. For a second they were just two scared kids from NYU again, holding each other up in the chaos.

The crowd compressed, bodies pressing from all directions. Ethan couldn't breathe, couldn't move. A woman in a hijab fell beside him; he pulled her up without thinking. She gripped his hand hard, terror universal across any divide. Someone was screaming in Hebrew. Someone else in Arabic. The same panic in different languages.

"ARE YOU A ZIONIST?"

A young activist, maybe nineteen, phone out, hunting for content. 

Ethan stared at the camera, his mouth dry. "I... I don't know what I am."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only honest one I have."

The activist moved on to easier targets. Ethan's hands were shaking.

Someone grabbed his arm from behind—a Jewish woman trying to pull him away from the chaos. "Come on," she said. "This isn't safe."

Ethan stopped. Pulled back. "No," he said. "I'm not running."

He looked across the divide at Aaron in his keffiyeh. Then at the Palestinian mother, walking away with her daughter.

The woman released his arm. "Your people need you," she said, uncertain.

"Which people?" 

She walked away without answering.

Ethan walked away, the protests still audible behind him. By the reservoir, a Jewish father taught his son to skip stones while wearing a "Ceasefire Now" button. Life continuing.

His phone buzzed with texts:

Aaron: "We need to talk. That woman, what she said..."

His mother: "Saw the news about Columbus Circle. Please tell me you're safe."

He answered only his mother: "I'm safe. Nothing here is."

He sat by the water. Ducks swam past, indifferent to human conflict.

Something was crystallizing—from Aaron in a keffiyeh, from the mother's story, from standing between corners and refusing both. The need to see for himself. Not from American distance.

That night, his laptop open to El Al's website. Flight prices to Tel Aviv. Departure dates scrolling past. His finger hovering over "Select."

His phone lit with a message from Aaron:

"I keep thinking about that woman. Her cousin. Remember the Darfur protest junior year? You said 'bearing witness isn't enough but sometimes it's all we have.' I thought that was bullshit. Now… My grandfather used to say 'Sometimes survival itself is resistance.' I don't know what to do with that."

Then:

"If you go, tell me what you see. Not what you're supposed to see. What you actually see."

Ethan stared at the screen. The cursor blinking in the departure date field. November 4th.

Outside, sirens wailed through Brooklyn.
