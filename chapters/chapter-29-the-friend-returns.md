# Chapter 29: The Friend Returns

Aaron Gold stood in Ethan's Jerusalem kitchen like an argument waiting to happen.

Tuesday morning, July. 7:18 AM. Jerusalem summer already brutal.

The doorbell rang.

Aaron stood there with a backpack, sweat stains on his shirt from the walk up. Five hundred and forty-one days since they'd really talked.

"I should have called."

"Yeah."

"I mean it. I should have—"

"You're here."

Aaron looked exhausted. Deeper than jet lag.

Sera appeared with Lev on her hip, Ari at her feet. She studied Aaron for a moment, then softened.

"You must be Aaron. Ethan's mentioned you."

"Has he?" Aaron's voice was careful. "Good things?"

"Things."

They moved to the kitchen. Coffee grounds from breakfast, toy blocks scattered, normal chaos.

Ethan made coffee. The good machine from the shuk that he'd finally learned to operate.

The twins played on the floor, oblivious.

"You look different," Aaron said.

"The water."

Neither of them smiled.

"How did you find me?"

"Your mother. She's worried. Made me promise to check you're eating."

"Still on her list?"

"Apparently."

"And are you? Here to talk sense?"

"I don't know why I'm here." Aaron gripped his coffee cup. "No—that's not true. I'm seeing someone. Six months. Her name is Layla."

The way he said her name—like confession.

"She's Palestinian."

The word sat between them.

"Columbia protest. Four months ago. You would have—" Aaron stopped. "Anyway."

"She asked me something." Aaron's voice went quiet. "'What kind of ally shows up to protests but can't name his great-grandparents? Knows every Palestinian village destroyed but not his own family's shtetl?'"

He paused.

"Her parents were worse. 'What kind of Jew defines himself only by what he opposes?'"

Ethan said nothing. What was there to say?

They should have fought. About October 7th. About Gaza. About everything.

Instead, exhausted honesty. The twins built and destroyed towers. Sera moved through the kitchen, knowing when to stay, when to leave. Outside: Hebrew, Arabic, car horns.

"I used Palestine to run from being Jewish."

"I used Israel to run from being human."

They sat with that.

Silence.

"Go walk," Sera suggested. "The market's open. Show him around."

She took Ari for his nap. Tactical withdrawal.

Machane Yehuda at mid-morning. Vendors shouting in Hebrew, Arabic, Russian. Tourists with cameras. Locals with wheeled carts. "Bibi Out" graffitied next to "Death to Arabs" next to "Hummus Not War."

Aaron's eyes darted everywhere, overwhelmed. The assault of Hebrew. Everyone arguing about tomatoes like it was war, discussing war like it was weather.

They walked. Aaron talked about Layla—her grandmother from Bethlehem, the key to a house that no longer existed.

"She made me realize I was using justice to avoid identity. Universal principles to escape being particular."

"She teaches me Arabic." They stopped for pomegranate juice. The vendor—Muhammad—knew Ethan, ignored Aaron. "Every word makes me realize how much Hebrew I never learned. Her grandmother sings about lost villages. I can't even name where my family came from."

German Colony café. Aaron ordered in English, the waiter answered in Hebrew, switched to English with visible annoyance.

"Layla's family asked: what kind of Jew are you?"

"They assumed I was a Jew. Would stay a Jew. Just asked what kind."

"And?"

"The wrong kind. The kind that knows Palestinian history but not Jewish history. The kind that can name every village destroyed in '48 but not one Yiddish poet."

"Her grandmother met mine once. Brooklyn, 1952. Two refugees."

"Small world."

"No. Just specific. That's what Layla says—everyone here has these stories. The connections we pretend don't exist."

Aaron was sweating. Not from heat.

"After October 7th, I posted about Gaza immediately. You disappeared. I thought you'd chosen tribe over truth."

"I thought you'd chosen politics over people."

"Maybe we both did."

"She says Palestinian suffering is real. Jewish fear is real. Both."

"That's it? That's the revelation?"

Aaron's jaw tightened. "Don't mock this."

"I'm not. I'm just—" Ethan stopped. "You protested at synagogues, Aaron. After October 7th. While Jews were mourning."

"While Palestinians were dying in Gaza."

"Both. Both were happening."

"And she's okay with you being...?"

"Jewish? She says she fell in love with Aaron Gold, not Aaron Nothing."

"That's convenient."

Aaron stood up. "Fuck you."

"Sit down."

"No, seriously, fuck you. You think this is easy? You think I flew here to get your approval?"

"Then why did you come?"

Aaron sat back down. "I don't know. Maybe because you're the only person who'd understand how hard it is to change."

The waiter brought more coffee, slammed it down harder than necessary. At the next table, someone was reading Haaretz. The headline: "Settlers Attack Palestinian Village." Aaron saw it. His shoulders tensed.

"After October 7th—"

"Don't."

"No, let me—when I saw your posts about vigils, about suddenly being Jewish Jewish, I thought you'd been brainwashed. Tribe over truth."

"And you chose what? Politics over dead Jews?"

"That's not—"

"You posted about Gaza two hours after the massacre. Two hours, Aaron."

"Because I knew what would come next. And I was right."

"You were right." Ethan's voice was flat. "Congratulations."

"And now?"

"Now I light candles on Friday night."

"Layla taught you?"

"She said I had to love myself to love her."

"How progressive."

"Stop it."

"Stop what? Being angry? You disappeared for a year and a half because I went to synagogue after a massacre."

"You disappeared to Jerusalem. You're raising Jewish kids in an apartheid state."

The word hung between them. Apartheid.

"Is that what Layla calls it?"

"That's what it is."

"Then why are you here?"

The café filled with lunch crowd. Tech workers, Russian immigrants, American expats. At one table, three generations of Israelis argued in Hebrew. At another, a Palestinian family ate in silence.

"Does she know you're here?"

"She suggested it."

"In Israel."

"She won't say the name. She calls it '48.'"

"And you?"

"I say both. Israel when I'm with you. Palestine when I'm with her."

"That must be exhausting."

"Everything about this is exhausting."

They sat with that. The exhaustion of it. The waiter cleared their cups, muttered something in Hebrew. Aaron flinched.

"What did he say?"

"Nothing."

"Ethan."

"He said 'another confused American.'"

"I want you to meet her."

"No."

"Ethan—"

"I can't meet your Palestinian girlfriend and pretend everything's fine. That we're all just going to light candles together and sing songs."

"I'm not asking you to pretend."

"Then what are you asking?"

Aaron looked lost. "I don't know. Maybe just... to still be friends even though we'll never agree about this."

"Different kinds of Jews," Ethan repeated, tasting the phrase, finding it less bitter than he'd expected. "Is that what we are?"

"You're here, living in Jerusalem, lighting Shabbat candles with your Israeli girlfriend and your Israeli children—"

"They're not—we're not—it's complicated—"

"Everything here is complicated. That's what Layla says. Americans want simple and the Middle East doesn't do simple, only Americans think it does, think they can solve it with the right framework, the right process, the right pressure. But the people actually living it know that complicated is the only honest way to be here."

They walked back. Aaron stopped at a playground. Israeli and Palestinian kids on the swings. Their mothers sat on opposite benches, watching, not talking.

"See?" Aaron said. "Coexistence."

"Their mothers aren't speaking."

"But the kids are playing."

"Until they're taught not to."

"This is what you found?" Aaron asked, watching Ethan watch the children, the question hanging for three full minutes—divine time, completion time, the time it takes to really see something instead of just looking at it.

"Part of it," Ethan said. "The other part is harder to explain. It's about feeling whole in a place that's broken. About being home in a place that's contested. About finding God in a place that's god-forsaken. About learning that Jewish means something more than trauma response, that Hebrew is a language not just a memorial, that Israel is real and Palestine is real and pretending otherwise is the least helpful thing anyone can do."

"Layla would like you," Aaron said. "The you you've become, not the you you were. Though she probably would have seen through that you too. She sees through everything. It's exhausting and necessary, like everything about loving her."

That evening, Aaron stayed for dinner. Ethan lit candles, still reading the blessing from a card. Aaron watched, uncomfortable. Sera's Hebrew prayers. The twins babbling. The smell of challah, over-sweet.

"I brought something." Aaron pulled out two children's books—one English, one Arabic. "From Layla. For the twins."

"Bridge stories," Ethan read. "Subtle."

"She says kids here need bridge stories."

"Kids everywhere do."

They left it at that.

On the balcony. Jerusalem's Friday night—religious neighborhoods dark, secular bars loud, Palestinian areas continuing as normal. The segregation visible even from here.

"I never understood 'Next year in Jerusalem,'" Aaron said, holding Ari awkwardly. "Now I'm here and I still don't."

"Maybe that's the point."

"What?"

"Not understanding. Just being here anyway."

Below: the muezzin's call. Hebrew music from another apartment. Russian conversation. Arabic. The sounds didn't blend. They never did.

"I'm not making aliyah."

"I didn't ask you to."

"But you think I should."

"I think you should do whatever. I'm tired of thinking about what anyone should do."

"You're raising kids in a country that—"

"That exists. That's complicated. That's home now."

"Home."

"Yeah."

Aaron handed Ari back. "I still think you're wrong."

"I know."

"But I missed you."

"Yeah."

Jerusalem at night. Each light a life, a position, an argument.

"Will you come back?"

"Maybe." Aaron shouldered his backpack. "Layla wants to visit her grandmother's village. What's left of it. She wants me to come."

"To Israel."

"She won't say the name. She says '48' or 'historical Palestine.'"

"That must make travel arrangements complicated."

Aaron almost smiled. "Everything's complicated."

"Will you go with her?"

"If she comes to Lithuania with me. To see where my grandfather's from. What's left."

"Trading ruins."

"Something like that."

They embraced at the door. Brief. Careful. Real.

"Thanks for the books."

"Thank Layla."

"I will."

"Tell her—" Ethan stopped. "Just tell her thanks."

"She says everyone here is building bridges or burning them. Sometimes the same bridge."

"Sounds about right."

Aaron turned to go, turned back. "We're okay?"

"We're something."

"But not enemies."

"No. Not enemies."

After Aaron left, Ethan stood on the balcony. His oldest friend disappearing into Jerusalem's segregated night. American passport. Jewish name. Palestinian girlfriend. All of it impossible. All of it real.

Sera came out. "He's different."

"We're all different."

"You're still friends?"

"I don't know. Maybe. We're something."

"Jews," she said.

"What?"

"You're Jews. That's what you are. Everything else is just details."

Inside, the twins slept. The books Aaron brought lying on the coffee table. Bridge stories in two languages that wouldn't meet. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

But the books sat there anyway, side by side.

That was something.
