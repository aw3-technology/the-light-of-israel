# Chapter 29: The Friend Returns

Aaron Gold stood in Ethan's Jerusalem kitchen like an argument waiting to happen.

Tuesday morning, July. 7:18 AM. The doorbell rang—Aaron with a backpack, sweat stains from the walk up. Five hundred and forty-one days since they'd really talked.

"I should have called."

"Yeah."

Aaron looked exhausted. Deeper than jet lag. *He's lost weight,* Ethan noticed. *And when did he start biting his nails?*

Sera appeared with Lev on her hip, Ari at her feet. She studied Aaron, then softened.

"You must be Aaron. Ethan's mentioned you."

"Good things?"

"Things."

Coffee grounds from breakfast. Toy blocks scattered. Normal chaos. Ethan made coffee—the good machine from the shuk he'd finally learned to operate.

"You look different," Aaron said.

"The water."

Neither smiled.

"How did you find me?"

"Your mother. Made me promise to check you're eating."

"And are you? Here to talk sense?"

"I don't know why I'm here." Aaron gripped his coffee cup. "No—I'm seeing someone. Six months. Her name is Layla."

The way he said her name—like confession.

"She's Palestinian."

The word sat between them.

"Columbia protest. Four months ago." Aaron's voice went quiet. "She asked me something: 'What kind of ally shows up to protests but can't name his great-grandparents? Knows every Palestinian village destroyed but not his own family's shtetl?'"

He paused.

"Her parents were worse. 'What kind of Jew defines himself only by what he opposes?'"

Ethan said nothing. The twins built towers. Sera moved through the kitchen, knowing when to stay, when to leave.

"I used Palestine to—" Aaron stopped, rubbed his face. "Fuck. I used Palestine to run from being Jewish."

"And I—" *What did I do?* "I used Israel to run from being human."

They sat with that. *Twenty years of friendship and we're just figuring this out now?*

"Go walk," Sera suggested. "Show him the market."

Machane Yehuda at mid-morning. Vendors shouting, tourists with cameras, locals with wheeled carts. "Bibi Out" graffitied next to "Hummus Not War."

Aaron's eyes darted everywhere, overwhelmed by Hebrew assault, everyone arguing about tomatoes like war.

They walked. Aaron talked about Layla—her grandmother from Bethlehem, the key to a house that no longer existed.

"She made me realize—" He paused, like he was still working it out. "I was using justice to... to avoid having to figure out who I actually was. You know? It's easier to be universal than particular."

German Colony café. Aaron ordered in English, the waiter answered in Hebrew, switched back with visible annoyance.

"Layla's family asked: what kind of Jew are you? They assumed I'd stay a Jew. Just asked what kind."

"And?"

"The wrong kind. The kind that knows Palestinian history but not Jewish history. Can name every village destroyed in '48 but not one Yiddish poet."

Aaron was sweating. Not from heat.

"After October 7th, I posted about Gaza immediately. You disappeared. I thought you'd chosen tribe over truth."

"I thought you'd chosen politics over people."

"Maybe we both did."

"She says Palestinian suffering is real. Jewish fear is real. Both."

"That's it?"

Aaron's jaw tightened. "Don't mock this."

"You protested at synagogues, Aaron. After October 7th. While—"

"I know what I did."

"—while Jews were mourning."

"While Palestinians were dying in Gaza. Were being—"

"Both. Both were fucking happening."

Ethan leaned forward. *Do I tell him about the candlesticks? About crying at the Western Wall?* "You want to know what changed me? It wasn't—it wasn't some big revelation. It was holding my grandmother's prayer book and realizing I'd inherited something I'd never bothered to... to unwrap, you know? That being Jewish wasn't just about—" He gestured vaguely. "What happened to us. But what we built. Despite everything. Languages, melodies, three thousand years of arguing about God."

Aaron started to interrupt.

"Let me finish. You can't outsource that. You can't protest your way into belonging somewhere else and call it justice."

Aaron sat back. "Jesus."

"Yeah. And I got tired of being ashamed of that. Tired of apologizing for taking up space in my own story."

The waiter brought more coffee, slammed it down. At the next table, someone read Haaretz: "Settlers Attack Palestinian Village." Aaron's shoulders tensed.

"After October 7th, when I saw your posts about vigils, about suddenly being—"

"Suddenly being what?"

"Jewish. I thought you'd been brainwashed."

"You posted about Gaza two hours after the massacre."

"Because I knew—" Aaron's voice cracked. "I knew what would come next. And I was right."

"You were right. Congratulations." *Why am I being such a dick?*

"Now I light candles Friday night."

"Layla taught you?"

"She said I had to love myself to love her."

"How progressive."

"Stop."

"Stop what? Being angry? You disappeared because I went to synagogue."

"You disappeared to Jerusalem. You're raising Jewish kids in a—" Aaron stopped.

"Say it."

"In an apartheid state."

The word sat there. *Is that what this looks like to him? To her?*

"Is that what she calls it?"

"She won't say Israel. Calls it '48.'"

"And you? What do you call it?"

Aaron rubbed his temples. "Depends who I'm talking to. Everything about this is fucking exhausting."

The café filled with lunch crowd. Tech workers, immigrants, expats. Three generations argued in Hebrew at one table. A Palestinian family ate in silence at another.

"I want you to meet her."

"No."

"Ethan—"

"I can't meet your Palestinian girlfriend and pretend we're all going to sing Kumbaya together."

"I'm not asking you to—"

"Then what? What exactly are you asking?"

Aaron looked lost. Younger than his thirty-three years. "Maybe just... maybe we can still be friends even though we'll never—we'll never agree on this."

They walked back. Aaron stopped at a playground—Israeli and Palestinian kids on swings, their mothers on opposite benches, not talking.

"See? Coexistence."

"Their mothers aren't speaking."

"But the kids are playing."

"Until they're taught not to."

That evening, Aaron stayed for dinner. Ethan lit candles, still reading from a card. Aaron watched, uncomfortable.

"I brought something." Aaron pulled out two children's books—one English, one Arabic. "From Layla. For the twins."

"Bridge stories. Subtle."

"She says—" Aaron shrugged. "She says kids here need them. I don't know. Maybe they do."

*Or maybe she's trying to fix something that can't be fixed with children's books,* Ethan thought but didn't say.

On the balcony. Jerusalem's Friday night—religious neighborhoods dark, secular bars loud. The segregation visible even from here.

"I never understood 'Next year in Jerusalem,'" Aaron said. "Now I'm here and I still don't."

"Maybe that's the point. Not understanding. Just being here anyway."

Below: muezzin's call, Hebrew music, Russian conversation. The sounds didn't blend.

"I'm not making aliyah."

"I didn't ask you to."

"I think you're wrong."

"I know."

"But I missed you."

Ethan felt something crack open in his chest—relief, resentment, grief all at once. *I missed fighting with him. I missed having someone who knew me before all this.* "Yeah. Me too."

Aaron shouldered his backpack. "Layla wants to visit her grandmother's village. What's left. She wants me to come."

"Will you go with her?"

"If she comes to Lithuania with me. To see where my grandfather's from."

"Trading ruins."

"Something like that."

They embraced at the door. Brief. Careful. Real.

"Tell her thanks for the books."

"She says everyone here is either building bridges or burning them." Aaron paused at the elevator. "Sometimes the same bridge. I think that's supposed to be profound."

Aaron turned to go, turned back. "We're okay?"

"We're something."

"But not—not enemies."

"No." *What are we then?* "Not enemies."

After Aaron left, Sera came out. "You're still friends?"

"I don't know. Maybe. We're something."

"Jews," she said.

"What?"

"You're Jews. That's what you are. Everything else is details."

Inside, the twins slept. The books Aaron brought lay on the coffee table—bridge stories in two languages. Ethan picked up the Arabic one, couldn't read a word. Set it down next to the English version.

*Will these actually help anything? Or is this just what guilty liberals do—buy books and call it progress?*

But the books sat there anyway. Side by side.

*That's something,* he supposed. *Maybe not much, but something.*
