# Chapter 33: The Light of Israel

Three years after October 7th, Ethan Israel Stone woke at 7:18 AM and wondered if this was what living felt like—or if he was just better at pretending. The alarm hadn't woken him; he'd been lying in bed since 5:41, watching Jerusalem lighten through the window, still counting time in precise increments. *Some habits never break,* he thought. *Maybe they're not supposed to.*

His phone showed seventeen notifications from work—startup life following him even here. The Slack that had once consumed him now felt distant, irrelevant.

Sera stirred beside him, her hand finding his chest, the steady heartbeat that still surprised him each morning. The twins slept in the next room, three years old today. Born during Passover 2024, when the sirens had been quiet for two weeks—the longest stretch of peace they'd known. The timing had felt symbolic: freedom and birth, exodus and arrival.

His parents slept in the guest room—visiting from New York, still adjusting. "It's so different than we imagined," his mother had said yesterday, though Ethan couldn't tell if that was disappointment or wonder in her voice.

The Old City at dawn: empty except for soldiers and insomniacs. Same route for three years. Muscle memory now, like his eighteen-minute showers had been in Brooklyn. *Am I just replacing one routine with another?* The thought came unbidden. *Same person, different backdrop?*

The coffee shop at the corner—the owner nodded as Ethan passed, a gesture of recognition across the divide. Some mornings they exchanged a few words. Today, just the nod.

The Wall. Some mornings it felt like comfort. Today it felt like a gravestone. The security checkpoint was routine now—three years of muscle memory.

His usual stone was unmarked today, warm from the morning sun.

The stone was warm. Always warm. Body heat from thousands of hands, or maybe something else. He didn't question it anymore.

He pulled out the paper, the note he'd written in Hebrew that now came naturally, not fluent but functional, the language that had been sleeping in his DNA awakening word by word, the alphabet that looked like mathematics becoming the mathematics of meaning, of prayer, of the daily negotiation with existence that required Hebrew's directness, its elimination of unnecessary words, its compression of eternity into syllables.

The note was simple:

"Ani Ethan Israel Stone.
Ben David v'Sarah shechazru.
Nechad shel Rivka shenish'ara.
Aba shel Ari v'Lev shelo yad'u galut.
Ba'al shel Sera sheher'eta li or.
Todah al hashevira shehovi'a shlemut mi-October Shiva.
Todah al hachoshech sheheira or.
Ani po. Hineni.
Or Yisrael doleket kadima."

I am Ethan Israel Stone.
Son of David and Sarah who returned.
Grandson of Rivka who survived.
Father of Ari and Lev who will never know exile.
Husband of Sera who showed me light.
Thank you for bringing wholeness from the breaking of October 7th.
Thank you for the darkness that revealed light.
I am here. Here I am.
The light of Israel burns forward.

He folded the paper, found a crack between stones, pushed it deep where it would join the millions of other prayers. The Wall was not just stone but repository, not just barrier but the eternal ear listening to every language, hearing every prayer. The sunrise turned Jerusalem gold.

"Still coming."

Rabbi Levi's voice behind him. Not a question. The rabbi looked tired—the weight of years showing.

"Where else would I—" Ethan stopped. "I mean, where else would I go?"

"America. Back to... back to the old life."

"And do what? Pretend this never—" Ethan's voice caught. "Pretend none of this happened?"

The rabbi almost smiled. "Some would say that's... that's easier."

"Some would be right. But—" He gestured vaguely at the Wall.

They stood together. Teacher and student, though the roles had blurred over three years.

"Three years," the rabbi said.

"Three lifetimes."

"Same thing in God's mathematics."

The sun crested the Mount of Olives. Golden light on stone. Instagram perfect, if you cropped out the razor wire.

"Your family?"

"Sleeping. Yours?"

"Praying. Elsewhere but praying."

The minyan formed. Ten men, just enough. Some faces were new—tourists, visitors. Some were constants, like Ethan.

Ethan wrapped tefillin. The leather straps left marks on his arm that lasted until noon. Sera said they looked like bondage marks. "They are," he'd told her. She hadn't laughed.

The prayers began—Shacharit, morning service, the same words said by Jews everywhere at this moment, the global synchronicity of prayer that made distance irrelevant, that connected Melbourne to Moscow to Manhattan to here, to this Wall, to this moment when Ethan Israel Stone davened with intention, with comprehension, with the knowledge that prayer wasn't request but recognition, wasn't asking but acknowledging, wasn't seeking but finding what was always there.

"Shema Yisrael..."

Hear O Israel. His name called in the essential prayer, the declaration that despite multiplicity, there was unity. The divine was not elsewhere but everywhere, not listening but being the listening itself.

His Hebrew was functional now. Accented. Mistakes in every sentence. But functional. The prayers came automatically, like his old product presentations had. Different product now. Same muscle memory.

"Abba! Abba!"

The twins' voices cut through morning prayer like joy itself, like life insisting, like the future running toward him on small legs that had learned to run in Jerusalem, on ground that contained every Jewish generation that had ever run toward fathers, toward futures, toward the possibility that this time, this return, this gathering would be the lasting one.

Ari reached him first, limping—he'd fallen yesterday, running during the siren. Already learning the Jerusalem run: not from play but from fear. Lev behind him, quieter since the bus bombing, since the weeks Ethan spent in the hospital. Three years old and already carrying the weight of almost-orphaned.

"Abba, your face is wet."

Not crying. Not exactly. The morning was humid, October in Jerusalem. *Or maybe I am crying and just don't recognize it anymore.* Three years of questions without answers. *What if Aaron's right? What if I'm just stubborn? What if this whole thing is just elaborate self-deception?*

"Happy tears," he said in Hebrew, though his voice wavered slightly. Their first language now, though sometimes he still searched for words.

Sera arrived, moving carefully—seven months pregnant now, their third child coming in spring. She'd adapted to Jerusalem like water finding its level.

"Quiet morning," she said, checking the horizon automatically. A habit now.

"Every morning," he replied, though part of him wondered if he meant it or just needed to mean it. *The emptiness is still there,* he realized. *I've just gotten better at furnishing it.* But maybe that was enough—his sons arguing in Hebrew, Sera humming while she cooked, the ordinary chaos that felt like home even when he questioned whether it was home or just another place he'd convinced himself to stay.

His parents appeared, having visited the women's section. His mother looked uncomfortable—not with the place but with herself, as if she'd discovered something unexpected and wasn't sure what to do with it.

"The children shouldn't—they shouldn't run here," his mother said, then caught herself. Her hand moved instinctively to her throat, where a small Star of David pendant had appeared sometime in the last year—a gift from Ethan she'd started wearing without explanation.

"Let them run," his father said, adjusting the kippah he still forgot he was wearing. "I mean... this is—" He paused, looking around. "This is their place, isn't it?"

"Saba!" Lev called to his grandfather, the Hebrew word that meant grandfather but also returned, the linguistic coincidence that wasn't coincidence, that was the language itself encoding return, insisting on it, making every grandfather a reminder that return was possible, was necessary, was the only response to exile that made sense.

They walked home together through the Jerusalem morning that was beginning its Thursday routine—shops opening, traffic building. *It looks like home,* Ethan thought. *But does it feel like home, or am I just committed to the performance?* The question followed him like a shadow. Arabs sold bread to Jews who sold coffee to Christians who sold souvenirs to tourists who didn't understand they weren't touring but participating, weren't observing but becoming part of the story, the narrative that included everyone who'd ever walked these streets, touched these stones, breathed this air that tasted of history, of prophecy, of the future that was also past that was also present, all tenses existing simultaneously in the grammar of return.

Their apartment overlooked the Old City. Purchased with his Brooklyn money when the shekel crashed. The view that had seemed worth everything until the missile alert system was installed on their balcony. Now they saw the city through metal slats.

"Coffee?" Sera asked. The same morning ritual that had grounded them since the early days.

"After," Ethan said, pulling out his notebook. Three years of trying to make sense of this choice, these changes, this life that felt both inevitable and impossible.

He wrote:

"October 7, 2026. Three years. The twins are three. Sera carries our daughter. I think I'm learning what it means to stay. Not certainty—I still wake up some mornings wondering if I'm fooling myself. But maybe that's part of it too. The doubt that keeps you honest. The light that flickers but doesn't go out. I am Ethan Israel Stone, still wrestling, still learning what that means. Still here."

Through the window, Jerusalem caught the morning light. Still beautiful. Still impossible. *Still here,* Ethan thought, and realized he was talking about the city and himself both.

Ari and Lev played with blocks, building and destroying. The game continued, as it always had.

Sera sang in the kitchen, Ladino melodies her grandmother had taught her. The old songs in the new place.

His phone buzzed. Another message he'd read later.

The old life felt distant now, like something that had happened to someone else. *But was that other person wrong to leave?* The doubt crept in despite himself. *Was that life actually empty, or was I just too afraid to fill it?*

"Abba, look!"

Lev's tower: seven blocks high, leaning left.

Ari raised his hand to topple it.

"Let it stand."

"It's going to fall anyway."

"Everything falls anyway. Let it... let it stand while it can."

The tower lasted thirty seconds. Longer than yesterday's. *Small victories,* he told himself, *or small delusions.*

Outside, the city stirred to life. Jerusalem beginning another day.

The coffee was good. Ethiopian beans, rich and complex. Everything here had layers of meaning if you looked for them.

Ethan sat at the kitchen table, solid wood, built to last. The first piece of furniture they'd chosen together for this life.

"Abba, teach me letters," Ari said, climbing onto his lap.

"Which letter?"

"The first one."

"Aleph," Ethan said, and began to draw it on the paper. His son's hand over his, learning the shape. "It makes no sound by itself."

"Why?"

"Because it's the... the breath before the word. The silence that—" He paused, searching. "That holds all sounds. I think."

Ari traced the letter, tongue out in concentration.

Through the window, Jerusalem. Still there. Still impossible.

His grandmother's candlesticks sat on the shelf—polished now, used every Friday. Beside them, new ones. Smaller. For the twins when they were older. If there was an older.

There would be. Had to be.

Ari drew another aleph. Better this time.

"What comes after aleph?"

"Bet," Ethan said. "It means house."

"Our house?"

"Every house. All houses. The—" Ethan hesitated. "The idea of house, I guess."

His son nodded as if this made perfect sense. Maybe here, it did.

They continued through the morning—father teaching son the ancient letters. Outside, the world continued. Inside, the simple act of learning.

Aleph. Bet. Gimmel.

*Beginning,* Ethan thought. *Or maybe just continuing.*
