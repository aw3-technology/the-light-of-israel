# Chapter 3: Slack and Spirits

The Slack notification read "drinks tonight?" and Ethan responded with a thumbs-up emoji he didn't feel.

Wednesday afternoon in SoHo, the eighteenth floor of a building that looked like every other building, in a conference room that could have been any conference room, discussing metrics that measured nothing that mattered while outside the September sun descended toward a horizon hidden behind glass and steel and the endless optimization of everything except what made life worth living.

"So if we adjust the onboarding flow here," Naomi was saying, laser pointer creating red dots on white walls like stigmata that meant nothing, "we should see a twelve percent increase in thirty-day retention."

Ethan nodded at the appropriate moment, made a note he wouldn't read, watched his pen move across paper in shapes that looked like language but felt like the motion of drowning. His phone face-down on the conference table had buzzed seven times in the last hour—Aaron organizing tonight's gathering with the efficiency of someone who'd learned to schedule spontaneity, Marcus making jokes that would sound funnier after drinks, Sarah sharing articles about climate catastrophe with fire emojis that seemed to miss the irony.

"Ethan, what's your take on the friction points?"

He looked up, found eight faces waiting for his expertise, his insight into why users abandoned their digital shopping carts like modern nomads leaving possessions in the desert, moving toward something they couldn't name with credit cards they'd maxed out trying to find it.

"The drop-off is happening right after payment method selection," he heard himself say, his voice coming from somewhere outside his body, a projection of competence that had learned to operate independently of his consciousness. "Users are second-guessing at the moment of commitment. Classic conversion anxiety."

Everyone nodded. Someone said "makes sense." Someone else said "let's A/B test it." The meeting moved on to other optimizations, other improvements to systems that were already optimized beyond recognition, like faces after too much surgery, technically perfect and completely lifeless.

His phone buzzed again. Aaron in the group chat: "Broken Shaker at 7? They have that mezcal you pretended to like last time."

Ethan typed back: "Can't wait to pretend again" with a laughing emoji that accurately represented nothing he felt.

The meeting ended at 5:41 PM—that number again, Israel, following him through his day like a shadow he couldn't see because he'd forgotten how to look for shadows. His colleagues dispersed to their desks, to their own Slack channels, to their own performances of productivity that produced nothing but the appearance of producing something.

At his desk, Ethan pulled up the dashboard that tracked user engagement across seventeen different metrics, each one precise to three decimal places, none of them measuring what users actually wanted, which was probably the same thing Ethan wanted—to feel something real, to connect to something beyond the screen, to stop optimizing and start living, though living itself had become something to optimize.

Josh stopped by, coffee in hand, casual lean against the desk partition that suggested friendship without requiring it. "You coming to drinks? Aaron's being particularly Aaron in the group chat."

"Yeah, heading out soon."

"Cool, cool. That date yesterday—Rachel? How'd it go?"

"Fine," Ethan said, the word that covered everything and revealed nothing. "Probably won't see her again."

"The apps, man. It's all fucking algorithms now. My cousin met his wife at a bookstore. Can you imagine? Just like, saw her reading something and started talking."

"Which bookstore?"

"I don't know, one that's closed now probably. They're all closed now."

Josh wandered off, leaving Ethan staring at his screen where the metrics continued their real-time updates, numbers climbing and falling like digital prayer, measuring engagement with precision while everyone grew more disengaged, including him, especially him.

The subway to Williamsburg was delayed—signal problems, the announcement said, though the signal had been problematic for years, decades maybe, the entire system held together by hope and habit and the lack of alternatives. Ethan stood on the platform checking his phone, scrolling through news he wouldn't remember, photos of people living lives that looked better from this distance, updates from friends who were already at the bar, already drinking, already performing their midweek ritual of caring about everything so intensely it looked like they cared about nothing.

When the train finally came, it was packed with people heading to Brooklyn for their own Wednesday night attempts at meaning—yoga classes and pottery workshops and book clubs and dinner parties, all the secular congregations of people who'd forgotten how to congregate around anything sacred but still felt the pull of gathering, still needed witnesses to their existence, still performed community without commune, unity without union.

The Broken Shaker sat on Metropolitan Avenue—the mother road, the original thoroughfare, though no one remembered why it was named that or what mother it honored. The bar had exposed brick that had been covered and uncovered so many times it had forgotten its original purpose, Edison bulbs that gave light without warmth, reclaimed wood that had been reclaimed from other bars that had also featured reclaimed wood, an infinite recursion of authenticity that had become its own kind of fakeness.

Three friends walked out as Ethan approached—their conversation ending, their drinks finished, their Wednesday night obligation to socialize completed. Through the window he could see his friends already assembled: Aaron holding court with gestures that suggested he was arguing a case, Sarah scrolling through her phone with the intensity of someone discovering something terrible that confirmed what she already believed, Marcus laughing at something on his screen that would become content for his newsletter tomorrow.

"Ethan!" Aaron spotted him first, standing to perform the brotherhood hug that involved backs being slapped exactly twice, no more, no less. "We're three rounds in, you need to catch up."

Aaron Gold looked like success was supposed to look—tailored shirt that suggested money spent thoughtfully, rimless glasses that made him seem both intellectual and approachable, the kind of carefully maintained stubble that required more effort than shaving. But something flickered behind his eyes when he smiled, a performance within a performance, like he was watching himself be Aaron Gold and finding the character unconvincing.

"Rough day?" Ethan asked, signaling the bartender, whose name tag read Gabriel though no one would notice the significance, no one would think messenger, angel, announcement.

"Every day's rough when you're defending people the system wants to disappear." Aaron's standard line, delivered with practiced passion. "But someone's got to do it, right?"

"Right," Ethan agreed, ordering an Old Fashioned he didn't want for eighteen dollars he wouldn't miss, participating in the ritual because not participating would require explanation, would mark him as outside the circle, would force him to acknowledge that he was already outside every circle, had been for months, maybe years.

Sarah looked up from her phone, her face carrying the particular exhaustion of someone who'd spent the day designing interfaces for apps that would fail within six months. "Did you guys see about the flooding in Pakistan? Twenty million people displaced. Twenty million."

"Climate change is literally ending the world and we're sitting here drinking cocktails," Marcus said, taking a long sip of his cocktail, the irony intentional but not enough to change anything. "Though to be fair, these are very good cocktails."

"Everything's content now," he continued, his journalist cynicism worn like armor against caring too much. "Even the apocalypse. Especially the apocalypse. My editor wants me to write about how millennials are handling extinction anxiety. Like, we're handling it with memes and medication, what else is there to say?"

"We're the most informed and least effective generation in history," Sarah said, and everyone nodded because it was true and because acknowledging truth felt like doing something about it.

"Speaking of ineffective," Aaron said, turning to Ethan, "how was the date with Rachel?"

"Fine. She was nice. We had nothing in common except our mutual emptiness." He hadn't meant to say the last part out loud.

"Damn," Marcus whistled. "That's dark, even for you."

"I mean, she was fine. It was fine. Everything was fine." The word felt like surrender in his mouth.

"You need to get back out there," Sarah said, her relationship advice coming from someone who hadn't dated in two years, who'd replaced intimacy with causes, romance with resistance. "What about that app where you answer philosophical questions?"

"All dating apps are the same app with different interfaces," Ethan said, his product manager brain unable to stop analyzing even this. "They're all optimizing for engagement, not connection."

"Capitalism ruins everything," Aaron said, raising his glass, and everyone clinked because it was easier than examining their own participation in the ruin.

The conversation drifted to safer territories—Netflix shows everyone was watching separately but discussing collectively, weekend plans that involved more drinking in different locations, the couple at the next table who were definitely on a first date going badly. Aaron ordered another round for everyone, his generosity part performance, part genuine care, the mixture impossible to separate.

"Did you see what's happening in Jerusalem?" Marcus asked, scrolling through his phone. "More settlements, more protests, same cycle."

Aaron's entire body changed, tightened, like someone had struck a tuning fork inside him. "Netanyahu's basically Trump, but worse because he's competent. And because he uses Judaism as cover for ethnic cleansing."

The words came out practiced, polished from repetition. Ethan watched Aaron's hands grip his glass, knuckles white, passion that looked like conviction but felt like something else, something closer to pain.

"It's complicated though," Sarah offered, carefully, knowing this was Aaron's trigger topic.

"It's not complicated. Apartheid isn't complicated. My grandmother didn't survive the Holocaust so Israel could become what tried to destroy her."

The table went quiet. Aaron never mentioned his grandmother, never mentioned the Holocaust, never mentioned being Jewish except in the context of criticizing Israel. It was like watching someone use their own bones as weapons, breaking themselves to make a point.

"Another round?" Gabriel the bartender asked, appearing at their table like an announcement none of them could hear.

"Yes," Aaron said too quickly. "Definitely yes."

Ethan's phone showed 18% battery—chai, life, the number following him while his actual life drained away in measured percentages. Around them, other groups of friends performed similar gatherings, similar conversations, the Wednesday night liturgy of the professionally successful and spiritually bereft, everyone so good at analyzing why everything was broken, no one knowing how to fix anything, especially themselves.

"I'm so tired of living through historical events," Sarah said, and everyone laughed because it was funny and because it was true and because laughter was easier than screaming.

"Remember when the worst thing was just regular capitalism?" Marcus asked. "Not late-stage capitalism, not climate capitalism, just regular exploitation we could pretend to ignore?"

"Those were the days," Aaron said, but his smile didn't reach his eyes, never reached his eyes anymore, not since his last relationship ended, not since he'd thrown himself into work like work could save him, like saving others could save himself.

"October's going to be rough," Sarah said suddenly, apropos of nothing, staring at her phone where news alerts accumulated like omens.

Behind the bar, an analog clock showed 7:07, stopped at that precise moment, no one noticing the stopped time, the suspended moment, the universe holding its breath for something that would happen in ten days, something that would shatter Aaron's careful compartmentalization, would force Ethan to remember what he'd forgotten, would make October rougher than any of them could imagine.

"I should head out," Ethan said, though it was early, though the night was just reaching the point where honesty might accidentally emerge.

"Already? Come on, one more round."

"Early meeting tomorrow."

"Capitalism never sleeps," Marcus said, raising his glass in mock salute.

Ethan hugged everyone goodbye—Sarah's embrace tight with loneliness she wouldn't acknowledge, Marcus's casual with cynicism that protected him from feeling, Aaron's lasting a moment too long, like he wanted to say something real but couldn't remember how.

Outside, the September night was warm enough to walk but Ethan ordered an Uber anyway, needing the transitional space, the moving nowhere that wasn't here or there or anywhere. Abraham wasn't driving tonight—the driver was silent, focused on navigation, providing no prophecies, no suggestions that what Ethan was looking for might be closer than he thought.

In the backseat, he watched the group chat continue without him—photos of drinks, jokes that required context, plans for next week that would be identical to this week. They were his friends, had been for years, but sitting in the dark car moving through Brooklyn, Ethan couldn't remember how they'd become friends or why they stayed friends or what friendship even meant when it was performed rather than felt.

His phone buzzed. A separate text from Aaron, outside the group chat: "Hey man, can we grab coffee tomorrow? Just us. Need to talk about something real."

The timestamp read 11:11 PM.

Ethan stared at the double ones, remembering his grandmother used to make wishes at 11:11, used to grab his hand and squeeze it, telling him to wish for something that mattered, not toys or candy but something real, something that would last, something that would make the world more whole.

Aaron never asked for "something real." Aaron performed passion about Palestine but never mentioned his own pain. Aaron defended everyone but himself. Aaron was drowning in plain sight and everyone was too drunk on their own drowning to notice.

"Of course," Ethan texted back. "Name the place."

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again. Finally: "That place in Carroll Gardens. The one with the terrible coffee but the old Italian guy who knows everyone's name. 10 AM?"

"See you there."

Ethan looked out at Brooklyn passing in the darkness—lights in windows where people were living lives that looked whole from this distance, families gathering for late dinners, couples watching shows together, children being put to bed with stories that began once upon a time and ended with meaning.

Tomorrow was Thursday, September 28th. Two days before his grandmother's yahrzeit. Two days before October. Aaron needing something real. Everything accelerating toward some moment none of them could see coming, like standing on train tracks feeling vibrations but unable to determine from which direction the impact would arrive.

Back in his apartment, Ethan lay in bed scrolling through Twitter, watching outrage cycle through his timeline like prayer wheels spinning without purpose, everyone so good at analyzing why everything was broken, everyone so broken by the analysis, everyone performing care about everything which meant caring about nothing, including themselves, especially themselves.

He thought about Aaron's white knuckles around his glass, about Sarah's climate anxiety that was really loneliness, about Marcus's jokes that were really screams, about himself sitting among them feeling nothing, saying the right words, making the right sounds, as empty as the reclaimed wood and exposed brick, authentic in all the ways that didn't matter, fake in the one way that did.

His phone battery died at exactly 18%—chai, life, the number trying to tell him something he couldn't hear over the sound of his own performance, his own optimized emptiness, his own drinks with friends who were strangers who were friends who were all drowning in the same Brooklyn bars, the same Wednesday nights, the same conversations about how broken everything was while they themselves broke a little more each week, each day, each moment they chose performance over presence.

Tomorrow Aaron would tell him something real. Tomorrow might be different. Tomorrow was always tomorrow, never today, never now, never this moment when the apartment was dark and Ethan was alone and somewhere in Brooklyn his grandmother's yahrzeit candle should be burning but wasn't, would never burn unless he lit it, unless he remembered how to light anything, unless he remembered what light was for.

He closed his eyes and tried to remember his grandmother's wish at 11:11, what she'd wanted for him, what she'd squeezed his small hand and hoped for, but all he could remember was the squeezing, the pressure of love that wanted something better for him than this, better than optimized emptiness, better than craft cocktails and progressive politics and friends who were performing friendship, better than Wednesday nights that bled into Thursday mornings that bled into nothing, nothing, nothing at all.
