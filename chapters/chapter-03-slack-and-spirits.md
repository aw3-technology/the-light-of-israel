# Chapter 3: Slack and Spirits

The Slack notification read "drinks tonight?" and Ethan responded with a thumbs-up emoji he didn't feel.

Wednesday afternoon in SoHo, the eighteenth floor of a building that looked like every other building, in a conference room that could have been any conference room, discussing metrics that measured nothing that mattered while outside the September sun descended toward a horizon hidden behind glass and steel and the endless optimization of everything except what made life worth living.

"So if we adjust the onboarding flow here," Naomi was saying, laser pointer creating red dots on white walls like stigmata that meant nothing, "we should see a twelve percent increase in thirty-day retention."

Ethan nodded at the appropriate moment, made a note he wouldn't read, watched his pen move across paper in shapes that looked like language but felt like the motion of drowning. His phone face-down on the conference table had buzzed seven times in the last hour—Aaron organizing tonight's gathering with the efficiency of someone who'd learned to schedule spontaneity, Marcus making jokes that would sound funnier after drinks, Sarah sharing articles about climate catastrophe with fire emojis that seemed to miss the irony.

"Ethan, what's your take on the friction points?"

He looked up, found eight faces waiting for his expertise, his insight into why users abandoned their digital shopping carts like modern nomads leaving possessions in the desert, moving toward something they couldn't name with credit cards they'd maxed out trying to find it.

"The drop-off is happening right after payment method selection," he heard himself say, his voice coming from somewhere outside his body, a projection of competence that had learned to operate independently of his consciousness. "Users are second-guessing at the moment of commitment. Classic conversion anxiety."

Everyone nodded. Someone said "makes sense." Someone else said "let's A/B test it." The meeting moved on to other optimizations, other improvements to systems that were already optimized beyond recognition, like faces after too much surgery, technically perfect and completely lifeless.

His phone buzzed again. Aaron in the group chat: "Broken Shaker at 7? They have that mezcal you pretended to like last time."

Ethan typed back: "Can't wait to pretend again" with a laughing emoji that accurately represented nothing he felt.

The meeting ended at 5:41 PM—that number again, Israel, following him through his day like a shadow he couldn't see because he'd forgotten how to look for shadows. Five forty-one, the gematria of his hidden middle name, appearing on clocks and receipts and flight numbers, the universe speaking in a language he'd never learned to read.

At his desk, Ethan pulled up the dashboard that tracked user engagement across seventeen different metrics, each one precise to three decimal places, none of them measuring what users actually wanted, which was probably the same thing Ethan wanted—to feel something real, to connect to something beyond the screen, to stop optimizing and start living, though living itself had become something to optimize.

Josh stopped by, coffee in hand, casual lean against the desk partition that suggested friendship without requiring it. "You coming to drinks? Aaron's being particularly Aaron in the group chat."

"Yeah, heading out soon."

"Cool, cool. That date yesterday—Rachel? How'd it go?"

"Fine," Ethan said, the word that covered everything and revealed nothing. "Probably won't see her again."

"The apps, man. It's all fucking algorithms now. My cousin met his wife at a bookstore. Can you imagine? Just like, saw her reading something and started talking."

"Which bookstore?"

"I don't know, one that's closed now probably. They're all closed now."

Josh wandered off, leaving Ethan staring at his screen where the metrics continued their real-time updates, numbers climbing and falling like digital prayer, measuring engagement with precision while everyone grew more disengaged, including him, especially him.

The subway to Williamsburg was delayed—signal problems, the announcement said, though the signal had been problematic for years, decades maybe, the entire system held together by hope and habit and the lack of alternatives. Ethan stood on the platform checking his phone, scrolling through news he wouldn't remember, photos of people living lives that looked better from this distance, updates from friends who were already at the bar, already drinking, already performing their midweek ritual of caring about everything so intensely it looked like they cared about nothing.

A busker played violin near the turnstiles, the melody almost Hebrew, almost familiar, almost like something his grandmother had hummed. Ethan walked past without stopping, without recognizing the niggun, the wordless prayer that followed him down the platform like smoke.

When the train finally came, it was packed with people heading to Brooklyn for their own Wednesday night attempts at meaning—yoga classes and pottery workshops and book clubs and dinner parties, all the secular congregations of people who'd forgotten how to congregate around anything sacred but still felt the pull of gathering, still needed witnesses to their existence, still performed community without commune, unity without union.

The Broken Shaker sat on Metropolitan Avenue—the mother road, the original thoroughfare, though no one remembered why it was named that or what mother it honored. The bar had exposed brick that had been covered and uncovered so many times it had forgotten its original purpose, Edison bulbs that gave light without warmth, reclaimed wood that had been reclaimed from other bars that had also featured reclaimed wood, an infinite recursion of authenticity that had become its own kind of fakeness.

Three friends walked out as Ethan approached—their conversation ending mid-sentence, their laughter cutting off like someone had pressed pause, their Wednesday night obligation to socialize completed with the precision of a transaction. Through the window he could see his friends already assembled: Aaron's shoulders set in the particular angle that meant he was about to deliver truth, Sarah scrolling through her phone with the intensity of someone discovering something terrible that confirmed what she already believed, Marcus deflecting something with the quick head shake he used when feelings got too close.

The air inside hit him immediately—hops and anxiety sweat, artisanal cologne failing to mask the desperation of another Wednesday, the bathroom door swinging open to reveal Hebrew graffiti on the stall that neither he nor Aaron would ever notice, couldn't read if they did, the ancient letters spelling "return" in a language they'd both forgotten.

"Ethan!" Aaron spotted him first, standing for the brotherhood hug that involved backs being slapped exactly twice, no more, no less. "We're three rounds in, you need to catch up."

Aaron Gold looked like success was supposed to look—tailored shirt that suggested money spent thoughtfully, rimless glasses that made him seem both intellectual and approachable, the kind of carefully maintained stubble that required more effort than shaving. But something flickered behind his eyes when he smiled, a performance within a performance, like he was watching himself be Aaron Gold and finding the character unconvincing. A thin gold chain caught the bar light at his throat—had that always been there? It disappeared under his collar before Ethan could see if anything hung from it.

"Rough day?" Ethan asked, signaling the bartender, whose name tag read Gabriel though no one would notice the significance, no one would think messenger, angel, announcement.

"Every day's rough when you're defending people the system wants to disappear." Aaron's shoulders settled into position as he spoke, the practiced angle of someone who'd said these words so many times they'd become muscular memory. "But someone's got to do it, right?"

"Right," Ethan agreed, ordering an Old Fashioned he didn't want for eighteen dollars he wouldn't miss, the bourbon sweet enough to hide the bitterness of another Wednesday, another performance, another night of pretending this was enough.

The drink tasted like burnt sugar and regret, with undertones of whatever Aaron wasn't saying.

Sarah looked up from her phone, her face carrying the particular exhaustion of someone who'd spent the day designing interfaces for apps that would fail within six months. "Did you guys see about the flooding in Pakistan? Twenty million people displaced. Twenty million."

"Climate change is literally ending the world and we're sitting here drinking cocktails," Marcus said, taking a long sip of his cocktail, the irony intentional but not enough to change anything. "Though to be fair, these are very good cocktails."

"Everything's content now," Marcus continued, his quick shoulder roll deflecting the weight of his own words, the gesture so practiced it looked natural. "Even the apocalypse. Especially the—"

"—the apocalypse," Sarah finished. "We know, Marcus. You've made this point before."

"Have I? Shit. I'm becoming my own rerun."

"My editor wants me to write about how millennials are handling extinction anxiety," Marcus added, swirling his mezcal which tasted like smoke and distance, like burning something you'd never get back. "Like, we're handling it with memes and medication, what else is there to say?"

"We're the most informed and least—" Sarah started.

"—effective generation in history," Aaron and Marcus said in unison.

"Now who's having reruns?" Sarah asked, but she was smiling, the kind of smile that suggested affection despite everything.

Music played overhead—something indie and forgettable, the kind of soundtrack for not making memories, punctuated by the rhythmic click of glasses being washed, the bar's dishwasher named Miguel singing something in Spanish that sounded like a prayer.

"Speaking of ineffective," Aaron said, turning to Ethan, "how was the date with Rachel?"

"Fine. She was nice. We had nothing in common except our mutual emptiness." He hadn't meant to say the last part out loud.

"Damn," Marcus whistled. "That's dark, even for you."

"I mean, she was fine. It was fine. Everything was fine." The word felt like surrender in his mouth.

A woman at the next table wore a Star of David necklace. Aaron's eyes caught it, slid away, returned, slid away again, like trying to look at the sun. His hand moved unconsciously to his throat where his own chain hid.

"You need to get back out there," Sarah said, though her phone screen showed three unread messages from someone named David she'd matched with six weeks ago and never responded to. "What about that app where you answer philosophical questions?"

"All dating apps are the same app with different interfaces," Ethan said. "They're all optimizing for engagement, not connection."

"Capitalism ruins everything," Aaron said, raising his glass with the particular force of someone trying to convince themselves, and everyone clinked because it was easier than examining their own participation in the ruin.

The conversation drifted—Netflix shows everyone was watching separately but discussing collectively, weekend plans that involved more drinking in different locations, the couple at the next table whose first date body language screamed last date. Aaron ordered another round for everyone—his fourth? Fifth? Ethan had lost count, but Aaron always ordered exactly seven drinks when something was eating him, a number he'd never explained and Ethan had never asked about.

"Did you see what's happening in Jerusalem?" Marcus asked, scrolling through his phone. "More settlements, more protests, same cycle."

Aaron's entire body changed, tightened, his jaw setting at an angle Ethan recognized from court, when opposing counsel said something that required controlled rage. "Netanyahu's basically Trump, but worse because he's competent. And because he uses Judaism as cover for—for—"

"Ethnic cleansing?" Marcus supplied.

"For destroying everything Judaism is supposed to mean." The words came out different than usual, less practiced, more torn. Aaron's hand gripped his glass hard enough that Ethan could hear the slight creak of stress on glass.

"It's complicated though," Sarah offered carefully, knowing this was Aaron's trigger topic.

"It's not complicated. Apartheid isn't complicated. My grandmother didn't survive the Holocaust so Israel could become what tried to destroy her."

The table went quiet. Aaron never mentioned his grandmother, never mentioned the Holocaust, never mentioned being Jewish except in the context of criticizing Israel. He was sweating now, despite the bar's aggressive air conditioning, the kind of sweat that came from inside, from wrestling with something that wouldn't let go. The word for that kind of wrestling almost surfaced in Ethan's mind—something with Israel in it—but the thought dissolved like sugar in bourbon.

"Another round?" Gabriel the bartender asked, appearing at their table like an announcement none of them could hear. Behind him, the clock still showed 7:07, stopped time that no one noticed, the universe holding its breath.

"Yes," Aaron said too quickly. "Definitely yes."

That made six. One more to go.

Ethan's phone showed 18% battery—chai, life, the number following him while his actual life drained away in measured percentages. He checked the time: 8:36 PM. Eight thirty-six. Eight times three times six. No pattern there, just numbers, just time passing without meaning.

Around them, conversations overlapped in the particular music of Brooklyn bars—someone explaining their startup too loudly, someone else crying in the bathroom, a group of women celebrating something with prosecco, their joy both real and performed for Instagram stories that would be forgotten by morning.

"I'm so tired of living through historical events," Sarah said, and everyone laughed because it was funny and because it was true and because laughter was easier than screaming.

"Remember when the worst thing was just regular capitalism?" Marcus asked. "Not late-stage capitalism, not climate capitalism, just regular exploitation we could pretend to ignore?"

"I was at that protest last week," Sarah started. "The one in Union Square? And there was this moment where—"

Her phone buzzed. She looked down, her face changing. "Sorry, what was I saying?"

"The protest," Aaron prompted, but he was already reaching for his own phone, the moment of potential connection severed by notifications, by the endless elsewhere of digital life.

"October's going to be rough," Sarah said suddenly, staring at something on her screen that made her face pale.

Behind the bar, the mezuzah painted over seven times still showed through, like truth insisting on itself despite every attempt at covering. The Hebrew inside, unseen for decades, continued its silent witness: "Hear, O Israel."

"I should head out," Ethan said, though it was early, though the night was just reaching the point where honesty might accidentally emerge, where Aaron might finally say what was haunting him, where they might stop performing and start being.

"Already? Come on, one more round."

"Early meeting tomorrow."

"Capitalism never sleeps," Marcus said, raising his glass in mock salute, his hand shaking slightly from too much coffee, too much bourbon, too much of everything except what mattered.

Ethan stood to leave, noticing the check on the table—$61.30 exactly. Six thirteen. The number hummed with significance he couldn't place, something about commandments, about obligation, about the weight of law he'd never learned but somehow carried anyway.

He hugged everyone goodbye—Sarah's embrace tight with loneliness she wouldn't acknowledge, Marcus's quick and sideways like he was already looking for the exit, Aaron's lasting a moment too long, his mouth opening like he wanted to say something, a Hebrew word trying to escape, something about tomorrow, about return, about—

"Tomorrow," Aaron said instead. "Coffee. Don't forget."

"I won't forget."

Outside, the September night was warm enough to walk but Ethan ordered an Uber anyway, needing the transitional space, the moving nowhere that wasn't here or there or anywhere. The driver's dashboard showed 10:55—his full name in gematria, Ethan Israel Stone, 1055, following him through the night in digital displays he'd never learned to read.

In the backseat, he watched the group chat continue without him—photos of drinks, Aaron's seventh and final drink appearing at 9:18 (or was it 9:11? The photo was blurry), jokes that required context, plans for next week that would be identical to this week.

His phone buzzed. A separate text from Aaron, outside the group chat: "Hey man, can we grab coffee tomorrow? Just us. Need to talk about something real."

The timestamp read 11:11 PM.

Ethan stared at the double ones, the numbers lined up like a portal, remembering his grandmother used to make wishes at 11:11, used to grab his small hand and squeeze it, telling him to wish for something that mattered, not toys or candy but something real, something that would last, something that would make the world more whole.

Aaron never asked for "something real." Aaron performed passion about Palestine but never mentioned his own pain. Aaron defended everyone but himself. Aaron was drowning in plain sight and everyone was too drunk on their own drowning to notice.

"Of course," Ethan texted back. "Name the place."

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again. Aaron typing and deleting, typing and deleting, trying to find words for something that existed before words, after words, beyond words.

Finally: "That place in Carroll Gardens. The one with the terrible coffee but the old Italian guy who knows everyone's name. 10 AM?"

"See you there."

Ethan looked out at Brooklyn passing in the darkness—lights in windows where people were living lives that looked whole from this distance, families gathering for late dinners where someone still said blessings, couples watching shows together in the kind of silence that meant everything had already been said, children being put to bed with stories that began once upon a time and ended with meaning.

Tomorrow was Thursday, September 28th. Two days before his grandmother's yahrzeit. Three days before October. Aaron needing something real. Everything accelerating toward some moment none of them could see coming, like standing on train tracks feeling vibrations but unable to determine from which direction the impact would arrive.

Back in his apartment, Ethan lay in bed scrolling through Twitter, watching outrage cycle through his timeline like prayer wheels spinning without purpose, everyone so skilled at diagnosing illness, so unable to cure it, everyone performing care about everything which meant caring about nothing, including themselves, especially themselves.

He thought about Aaron's white knuckles around glass that might shatter, about the gold chain hidden under his collar like a secret, about seven drinks like seven days of creation or seven days of mourning, about Sarah's unread messages from David who was probably Jewish, probably nice, probably exactly what she didn't want because what she wanted was to want something. He thought about Marcus's quick defensive gestures, armor made of irony, about himself sitting among them feeling nothing, saying the right words, making the right sounds, as empty as the reclaimed wood and exposed brick, authentic in all the ways that didn't matter, fake in the one way that did.

The battery notification appeared—18% again, chai, life—but he dismissed it, letting the phone die its small death, letting the group chat continue without witness, letting Brooklyn night sounds filter through his windows: sirens and laughter and somewhere, faintly, singing from the Lubavitcher house four blocks away, their Wednesday night study group ending with a melody his grandmother would have known, would have hummed while cooking, would have sung him to sleep with when sleep still meant rest instead of temporary death.

Tomorrow Aaron would tell him something real. Tomorrow might be different. Tomorrow was always tomorrow, never today, never now, never this moment when the apartment was dark and Ethan was alone and somewhere in Brooklyn his grandmother's yahrzeit candle should be burning but wasn't, would never burn unless he lit it, unless he remembered how to light anything, unless he remembered what light was for.

He closed his eyes and tried to remember his grandmother's wish at 11:11, what she'd wanted for him, what she'd squeezed his small hand and hoped for, but all he could remember was the squeezing, the pressure of love that wanted something better for him than this, better than optimized emptiness, better than craft cocktails and progressive politics and friends who were performing friendship, better than Wednesday nights that bled into Thursday mornings that bled into nothing, nothing, nothing at all.

Except for Aaron's gold chain catching light.
Except for seven drinks like a code.
Except for 11:11 lined up like a doorway.
Except for tomorrow, when something real might finally break through.
