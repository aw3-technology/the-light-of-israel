# Chapter 31: Vision on the Mount

The Temple Mount at dawn, empty except for birds, and Ethan Israel Stone saw what was, what is, and what might be.

He hadn't planned to be there. Jews rarely received permission to ascend, and when they did, it came with restrictions. But around 6 AM on the last day of Sukkot, walking the Old City walls in the half-light, something pulled him toward the Mughrabi Gate.

The guard looked up from his phone. Ahmad al-Rashid, according to his name tag, mid-forties, wedding ring worn thin. Dark circles under his eyes. He'd been here all night.

"You don't have permission," Ahmad said in accented English, but without conviction. His shoulders sagged with something heavier than fatigue.

"No."

They stood there. Ahmad glanced at the security camera, back at Ethan, rubbed his face with both hands. "My daughter. She's sick. Leukemia. The doctors at Hadassah..." He stopped. "Yesterday she said she dreamed of a man with light. American. Said he would come to the morning gate."

Ethan felt something shift in his chest—fear or recognition.

"Seven years old. She shouldn't—" Ahmad shook his head. "Kids that age, they say crazy things. But she described your face." He looked around—they were alone, but never really alone here. "Morning shift arrives in twelve minutes."

Ahmad punched numbers into the security pad. His hands shook. "If they check the logs..."

"They'll see what?"

"Malfunction. Coffee spill on the keypad, maybe. Happens." Ahmad's jaw worked. "My grandfather called prayer here forty years. Now my son won't visit from Berlin. Says he's ashamed of us all." A bitter laugh. "You have children?"

"Twin boys."

Ahmad nodded, something settling between them. Two fathers in a place that buried fathers. "Then you know. We do stupid things for them."

The lock clicked.

"Quickly."

Ethan climbed the wooden ramp, legs unsteady. At the top, the plaza opened—limestone worn smooth by millions of feet. Jerusalem sage sharp in the October air. A cat watched from beneath an olive tree, tail twitching at nothing visible.

The Dome of the Rock caught first light, gold burning against blue sky. Al-Aqsa stretched elegant to the south. Between them, the vast plaza where everything had happened and was still happening.

Birds erupted—dozens of doves. Wings like scattered prayers.

Ethan's vision began to blur. He hadn't eaten yet. The altitude. Or something else. The stones beneath his feet seemed to pulse with their own heartbeat.

Then fire.

Not metaphor—actual heat on his face. The taste of ash, the sound of stones falling like tears. He was watching it burn. Rome taking what couldn't be taken, only transformed. Each falling stone a prayer interrupted.

Terror flooded him. *What is this? Am I dying? Having a stroke?* His grandmother's voice: "Sometimes God speaks in ways that hurt."

The Dome blazed golden. Beautiful and contested—both true simultaneously. He heard the call to prayer, men arriving for Fajr, their prostrations like tides against stone.

The vision shifted—forward, backward, inward. Children playing where children had always played, where children might play again. Arab and Jewish children together. Then separated by walls. Then together again. The images collapsed into each other, showing everything and nothing.

He saw himself as a bridge between worlds—then the bridge cracking, then himself falling, then rising. The metaphors wouldn't hold still, wouldn't make sense, wouldn't stop.

*This is madness,* some part of him thought. *Or holiness. Probably both.*

When his sight cleared, he was sitting on stones, Ahmad pressing water to his lips. "You fell. Hit your head."

"Did you see—"

"I saw you fall." Ahmad's face was careful, neutral. Then, quieter: "My grandfather had visions here. Before the medications. Said this place..." He gestured helplessly. "Shows you things."

"What did you see?"

Ahmad was quiet for a moment, eyes on the golden Dome. "A man who needed water. A father thinking of his sick daughter." He paused, almost smiled. "Birds flying in circles. Could mean anything. Or nothing."

They traded numbers without talking about why.

Ethan walked back as Jerusalem woke—shops opening, children heading to school, the ordinary miracle of a city that had died and revived more times than anyone could count. His head throbbed. The vision felt distant now, like trying to remember a dream.

At home, Sera was feeding the twins. Ari fussing, Lev patient. She looked up, saw his face.

"Where were you?" 

"Walking. The Old City." 

"You look awful." Her voice sharpened. "What happened? Ethan, you're scaring me."

"I think... I don't know what happened." He sat heavily. "I was on the Temple Mount somehow and I had some kind of—vision? Seizure? I don't know."

"The Temple Mount?" She set down Avi's bottle. "How did you—"

"Long story." He rubbed his temples. "Yesterday was integration, right? I felt whole for the first time. But this morning something cracked open again. Like—like wholeness isn't permanent. Like it has to happen again and again."

Sera touched his forehead. "You're burning up. When did you last eat?"

She handed him Ezra, who immediately spit up on his shirt. The vision faded against this immediate reality—diapers and formula, the daily work of keeping small lives alive.

But something had shifted. Or nothing had. He'd either touched the divine or had a minor medical episode. The Mount kept its secrets.

That evening, Ahmad texted: "Daughter's fever broke. Doctors say good sign."

Then: "What you saw this morning. My grandfather used to say this place shows people what they need to see. Good and bad together."

Then: "Better delete these."

Ethan deleted them, but the words remained. Like the vision—maybe neurons misfiring in a charged place. Maybe something else. Maybe it didn't matter which.

He thought of Samira's students and the girl at the checkpoint; Ahmad's daughter belonged beside his own boys now, not as a counterpoint but as part of what he held when he said this city out loud.

He put the boys to bed, started the Shema, then stopped. The words felt suddenly foreign in his mouth, too big, too certain.

"Shema..." he began again, then just hummed the melody.

Avi looked at him with dark, serious eyes. Ezra had already fallen asleep.

Outside, sunset over Jerusalem, every stone looking like it held fire from within.

Somewhere on the Temple Mount, Ahmad was finishing his shift, thinking about his daughter, his son who wouldn't visit, the American who'd fallen or floated or something between.

Ethan touched where his head had hit stone. The bump was real. The vision felt real too, though he couldn't say how.

He sat on the stairwell for a minute before going in—cool air, old dust, a custodian's broom somewhere below. He breathed until his hands steadied.

The not-knowing felt more honest than knowing would have been.
