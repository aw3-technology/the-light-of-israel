# Chapter 18: The Other Side of Evil

Earlier that afternoon, Ethan had lost himself on purpose in the Old City's narrow arteries and been found by a woman carrying a stack of workbooks. "You're in the wrong quarter for looking that lost," she said, amused more than annoyed. Samira taught third grade at an Arab school near Herod's Gate. She walked him two turns and a stairwell shortcut he'd have missed, pointing with her chin at lintels and inscriptions he would not have seen alone.

"You see stones that remember your Temple," she said, palm on a sun-warmed wall. "I see stones that remember my grandfather's house." She said it without accusation, like a teacher labeling two drawings of the same scene. At Damascus Gate they parted—she to catch a bus, he to wander—her tote bag bumping against her leg like a metronome.

Near a checkpoint, a teenage girl in a school sweater waited, notebooks hugged to her chest. When the turnstile clicked she stepped through, eyes straight ahead, ponytail swinging. No one spoke. The city inhaled, exhaled, kept moving.

Jerusalem evening. Ethan sat in Rabbi Levi's study, Negev dust still in his clothes, char smell in his hair. Three days since Be'eri. Three days since Nova. His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

Samira's words kept echoing: two drawings of the same scene. The Palestinian girl at the checkpoint, eyes straight ahead. Different terrors, same city.

The radiator ticked. Same study, same lamp, everything wrong-angled.

"First tea, then Torah," Rabbi Levi said, voice gentle for the walking wounded.

The tea glass burned his fingers—mint, oversweetened. Through the window, the Old City walls caught last light.

"At Be'eri, they found a child's drawing," Ethan said. "Crayon on notebook paper. House with a red roof, stick figures holding hands." He stopped. The rest—seven hours, the hiding, the girl—he couldn't say aloud.

Rabbi Levi's eyes stayed steady. "She survived. That's what matters."

"Don't." The word came out hard. "Don't make meaning from her terror. Don't turn her hell into metaphor."

"I'm not making meaning. I'm finding what already exists."

The last students had left—Russians, Americans, Israelis. They'd looked at him and known. Everyone recognized someone who'd been south.

Rabbi Levi locked the door. "Privacy for this."

He pulled a volume from the shelf—cracked binding, brown pages.

"You asked how God allows evil." The rabbi opened to a marked page. "Wrong question. The question is: what is evil for?"

"For?" The word came out strangled. "Murder has purpose? Rape has function?"

The rabbi drew two diagrams—mirror images, one clear, one distorted.

"There's this idea—the Other Side. Not the opposite of holiness, but..." He searched for words. "Like shadows. They only exist where light gets blocked."

Ethan stared at the diagrams. "That's not what Samira said. She said we see different things because we are different people."

"Maybe both are true," the rabbi said quietly.

Ethan stared at the Hebrew text. The letters swam. "This is just—philosophy. Theory. Those people are still dead."

"Yes. They are." The rabbi's voice was quiet. "Philosophy doesn't bring them back. But maybe it keeps us from joining them—in despair, I mean."

The door opened—Sera with her own key. She looked between them, understood. Ethan's phone buzzed. Aaron calling. He declined it, but not before seeing the text preview: "Met someone. Palestinian activist. You'd hate her. Or maybe you'd understand. Can't tell anymore."

She looked at the open book, the diagrams. "More mystical explanations?"

"He's trying to understand—"

"Understand what? That evil has a purpose?" She turned to Ethan. "My brother killed himself last year. Jumped from a building in Tel Aviv. You want me to find the mystical meaning in that?"

"How?"

"There's supposed to be light trapped in darkness," she said, voice tight. "Every good act frees some of it."

"That sounds like bullshit," Ethan said.

"It is bullshit." Sera stood up abruptly. "But what else do we have? Logic? Facts?" She laughed bitterly. "The facts are that children are dead and evil exists and..."

She didn't finish.

The rabbi turned to another page. The Hebrew somehow made sense:

The rabbi closed the book. "Look, I don't have answers. Just old stories that sometimes help."

"October 7th..." Rabbi Levi started, then stopped. "I don't know what October 7th was. I just know we're still here."

"That doesn't feel like enough."

"No," the rabbi said. "It doesn't."

The muezzin's call began. Below, someone sang Shabbat melodies early.

"Israel," Rabbi Levi said. "Wrestling with God. Also yashar-El—straight to God. Direct connection despite everything."

"I don't feel connected to anything. If there is a God, and God let October 7th happen—"

"Then you're angry."

"Yes."

"Good." The rabbi moved to a cabinet. "Stay angry. Don't let anyone talk you out of it."

"Connection? I want to punch something."

The rabbi was quiet for a moment. Then he moved to a cabinet, pulled out something wrapped in velvet.

Tefillin. Black leather boxes and straps.

"Try these. Tomorrow morning. Not because they'll fix anything. But because doing something, anything, is better than drowning."

"How does wrapping leather help? I mean, really. What's leather going to do against—" He gestured vaguely south.

The rabbi was quiet for a long moment. "I don't know. Honestly."

Sera stood abruptly. "I need air. This room is—" She didn't finish, just headed for the door.

They climbed toward the Mount of Olives in silence. Cemetery stones faced the Temple Mount.

"Your grandmother planted trees. Seventeen of them." Rabbi Levi's voice was quiet. "They survived the 2010 fire."

Ethan didn't ask how he knew. Some conversations were too fragile for questions.

They walked back through shuttered markets, late-night learning spilling from yeshiva windows.

At the study, Sera handed him the velvet bag. "Tomorrow morning. Early."

"Is it hard to put on?"

"The physical part? No. Kids learn it. But getting up at the same time every morning, believing it matters when the news is full of—" She shrugged. "That's the hard part."

Rabbi Levi paused at his door. "Look, I don't understand any of this. Maybe it's all just—" He rubbed his forehead. "My wife thinks I'm losing my mind. Maybe I am. But the tefillin... just try them. The doing might teach us something the thinking can't."

Ethan walked home alone, tefillin in one pocket. Jerusalem at midnight: soldier checking his phone, Arabic radio from a taxi, someone practicing violin.

In his apartment, he set the velvet bag on his kitchen table. Tomorrow he would try. Maybe it would help. Maybe it wouldn't.

A yahrzeit candle flickered in the building across the street. Someone else's grief, burning through the night.

His grandmother's seventeen trees were still growing somewhere in the Carmel Forest. That seemed impossible.

But apparently impossible things happened all the time.
