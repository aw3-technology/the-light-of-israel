# Chapter 18: The Other Side of Evil

"After what you've seen," the rabbi said, "you need to understand where evil comes from."

December evening in Jerusalem. Ethan sat in Rabbi Levi's study, Negev dust still in his clothes, char smell in his hair. Three days since Be'eri. Three days since Nova. His hands wouldn't stop shaking—a physiological response, the medic had said, to prolonged proximity to trauma sites. Normal, she'd assured him. It would pass.

The radiator ticked. The same study, same lamp, but everything felt shifted, wrong-angled.

"Sit," Rabbi Levi said, his voice carrying the particular gentleness reserved for the walking wounded. "First tea, then Torah. First comfort, then comprehension."

The tea glass burned his shaking fingers—mint, oversweetened. Through the window, the Old City walls caught the last light.

"At Be'eri, they found a child's drawing," Ethan said suddenly. "Crayon on notebook paper. A house with a red roof, stick figures holding hands. The paper was—" He stopped. "Seven hours that girl hid. Her little brother's drawing in her hand the whole time."

Rabbi Levi's eyes stayed steady on his. "She survived. That's what matters."

"Don't." The word came out harder than Ethan intended. "Don't make meaning from her terror. Don't turn her hell into metaphor."

"I'm not making meaning, Ethan Israel. I'm finding the meaning that already exists. There's a difference."

Other students were leaving as he'd arrived—Russians, Americans, Israelis. They'd looked at him and known. Everyone recognized someone who'd been south.

Rabbi Levi waited until the last student left, then locked the door. "Privacy for this conversation. What we discuss tonight, the Zohar calls dangerous knowledge. Not because it's wrong, but because it's easily misunderstood."

He pulled a volume from the shelf—cracked binding, brown pages. The Zohar.

"You asked how God allows evil." The rabbi opened to a marked page. "Wrong question. The question is: what is evil for?"

"For?" Ethan's voice cracked on the single syllable. "Murder has a purpose? Rape has a function? Burning families alive serves some divine plan?"

The rabbi drew something on a piece of paper—circles connected by lines, Hebrew letters at each junction. The Tree of Life, Ethan recognized from his grandmother's books, though he'd never understood what it meant beyond decoration, mystical wallpaper for the spiritually inclined.

"Look," Rabbi Levi said, then drew another tree beside it, mirror image but somehow wrong, like a reflection in dark water. "The Sitra Achra. The Other Side. Not the opposite of holiness, but its concealment."

The lamp flickered once. A door slammed somewhere below.

"Ein Sof contracted itself," the rabbi continued quietly. "Tzimtzum. God withdrew to create space. In that absence, something else became possible."

"Evil."

"The possibility of choosing evil. Without that, no free will. Without free will, no love."

Ethan's fists clenched. Philosophy meant nothing next to a child's last terror. But something in the rabbi's voice held him.

"Klipot," Rabbi Levi said, drawing shells around the dark tree. "Husks hiding light. Like depression was a shell around your soul."

"My depression isn't comparable to murder."

"No. But the structure is the same. Concealment. Your grandmother—she survived the ultimate concealment. Bergen-Belsen. Spring 1945. And she chose to keep light alive anyway."

The door opened—Sera with her own key. She looked between them, understood immediately.

"You're teaching him about the Other Side," she said, not a question.

"He's been there," Rabbi Levi replied. "He needs a map to return."

She sat beside him. Jerusalem winter clung to her coat—wet stone and smoke.

"I studied this after my brother." She touched the diagram. "Suicide. It didn't make it easier. But it made it bearable."

"How?" Ethan asked.

"Because the shells crack. Every mitzvah gathers sparks from darkness. We're not fighting evil. We're liberating light."

The rabbi turned to another page. "Read this."

"I can't read Hebrew that complex."

"Try."

Ethan looked at the page. The Hebrew somehow made sense:

"The Other Side feeds on judgment without mercy. It grows strong on separation. It thrives where divine image is forgotten. But it cannot create, only distort. Cannot love, only possess. Cannot endure, only destroy until it destroys itself."

"October 7th was the Other Side showing its face." He gestured toward the window. "But look—Jews returning from everywhere. The shells cracked."

"That doesn't justify—"

"Nothing justifies. But everything serves, even evil."

His phone buzzed—18:36. Through the window, the muezzin's call began. Below, someone sang Shabbat melodies early. Church bells marked the hour.

"Your middle name," Rabbi Levi said. "Israel. Wrestling with God. Also yashar-El—straight to God. Direct connection despite everything."

"I don't feel connected to anything."

"That's the klipah talking. The shell around your soul, cracked but not yet fallen away." The rabbi stood, moved to a cabinet, pulled out something wrapped in velvet. "Your assignment. Your specific tikkun."

He unwrapped it—tefillin. Black leather boxes and straps. Ethan had seen them on men at the Wall, never understood their purpose.

"Every morning," Rabbi Levi said. "Bind them on your arm and head. Physical shells containing divine words. The opposite of klipot—instead of shells hiding light, shells revealing it."

"I don't know how—"

"Sera will teach you. The practice matters more than perfection. The binding matters more than belief."

"I saw evil." The words came out raw. "Real evil. Bodies. Families. How does wrapping leather straps help?"

The rabbi's eyes filled—not quite tears. "Every morning you'll bind divine words to your body. The mitzvah will choose you back. The shells will crack."

Sera stood. "Come. We need air. We need to walk. We need to move or this knowledge will settle too heavy."

They left together, walking through streets slick with evening rain. The smell of baking bread from an Arab bakery. A cat darting between shadows.

They climbed toward the Mount of Olives. The cemetery stretched below—thousands of white stones facing the Temple Mount. His grandmother had wanted to be buried here, he remembered suddenly. But she'd chosen Haifa instead, facing the sea.

"Here," Rabbi Levi said, gesturing at the view, "is where good and evil meet. Where Isaac was almost sacrificed. Where the Temple stood and fell and stood and fell. Where Muhammad ascended and Jesus wept and David danced. Every tradition. Every revelation. Every concealment."

"What am I supposed to do with this?" Ethan asked. "This knowledge about shells and sparks and Other Sides? How does it help those families in Be'eri? How does it resurrect the dancers at Nova?"

"It doesn't," Sera said. "Nothing resurrects the dead except the dead themselves, if you believe in that. But it might resurrect you. The you that died when you saw what you saw. The you that needs to live anyway, to choose anyway, to bind tefillin tomorrow morning anyway."

The wind picked up, carrying scents of za'atar and garbage, incense and cigarettes, all of Jerusalem's contradictions made olfactory. Below them, memorial candles flickered in windows—one, ten, hundreds, each one a small rebellion against darkness, each one gathering sparks as the rabbi had said, though whether that was truth or necessary fiction Ethan couldn't tell and was learning not to need to know.

"Your grandmother," Rabbi Levi said, "lost everyone in Bergen-Belsen. Her parents, March 1945. Her sister, April. She kept a spoon from the camp—her only possession. Later she came here and planted trees. I have the certificates—JNF, 1952. She planted one for each family member she lost. Seventeen trees. I counted."

"You knew her?"

"She came to Jerusalem after liberation. April 15, 1945—British forces entered Bergen-Belsen. Your grandmother was twenty-two, weighed thirty-one kilograms. She kept that spoon I mentioned. Used it to dig her first planting hole here." He pulled something from his pocket—a small stone, smooth, worn. "From the Kotel. Put it on a grave when you go back."

"Why would I go back?"

"Because you picked up that child's drawing. You kept it. It's in your jacket pocket right now."

They walked back through the Arab Quarter, shuttered shops and suspicious eyes, then through the Jewish Quarter where late-night learning spilled from yeshiva windows, then through the Armenian Quarter silent and strange, then through the Christian Quarter where pilgrims slept in hostels dreaming of holiness.

At the rabbi's study, Sera handed him the velvet bag. "Tomorrow morning. 7:18. I'll show you how."

"Is it hard?"

"The binding? No. The choosing to bind—that's hard."

Rabbi Levi paused at his door. "The Zohar says evil only exists in lower worlds. In higher worlds, the light is too strong."

"But we live here."

"Yes. That's why we have mitzvot. Not rules—technologies. You don't have to believe. Just do. The doing teaches."

Ethan walked home alone, the tefillin in one pocket, the folded drawing in another—crayon wax flaking off where he'd creased it. Jerusalem at midnight: a soldier checking his phone, Arabic radio from a passing taxi, somewhere the sound of someone practicing violin.

His phone showed 11:36. In his pocket, the child's drawing—those stick figures still holding hands despite everything. Tomorrow he would try the tefillin. His grandmother's spoon was in a museum now, he'd learned. But her trees still grew in the Carmel Forest.

Tonight he walked through Jerusalem carrying a child's drawing and new words for old wounds. The paper crinkled with each step.

A yahrzeit candle flickered in a window. Someone's annual remembering. His grandmother never lit them—"The dead don't need candles," she'd said once. "They need trees."

Seventeen trees for seventeen family members. Each one with a small metal plaque, weather-worn now but still readable. He'd looked them up—they survived the 2010 Carmel fire. Still growing.

Walking through Jerusalem, Ethan felt something shift in his chest. Not healing—too soon for that. But the possibility of it.

The Other Side was real.

So was this side.

Tomorrow morning at 7:18, he would choose.

In one pocket, the tefillin. In the other, a child's drawing—red crayon roof, stick figures holding hands. Both waiting for tomorrow.

Not because he understood.

Because understanding wasn't the point.

The point was choosing.

The child had drawn her family before October 7th. Still held them together on paper after. That was all anyone could do—hold things together despite evidence of breaking.

The Sitra Achra. The Other Side.

But also this: seventeen trees in the Carmel Forest. A spoon in a museum. A child's drawing in his pocket.

Tomorrow, 7:18.

He would try.

His grandmother had dug her first hole with a spoon from hell. Planted something anyway.

Maybe that's all anyone could do.

The shells would crack or they wouldn't.

He would bind the leather straps anyway.

The doing would have to be enough.
