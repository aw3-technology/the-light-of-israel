# Chapter 18: The Other Side of Evil

"After what you've seen," the rabbi said, "you need to understand where evil comes from."

December evening in Jerusalem. Ethan sat in Rabbi Levi's study, Negev dust still in his clothes, char smell in his hair. Three days since Be'eri. Three days since Nova. His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

The radiator ticked. Same study, same lamp, everything wrong-angled.

"First tea, then Torah," Rabbi Levi said, voice gentle for the walking wounded.

The tea glass burned his fingers—mint, oversweetened. Through the window, the Old City walls caught last light.

"At Be'eri, they found a child's drawing," Ethan said. "Crayon on notebook paper. House with a red roof, stick figures holding hands. The paper was—" He stopped. "Seven hours that girl hid. Her little brother's drawing in her hand."

Rabbi Levi's eyes stayed steady. "She survived. That's what matters."

"Don't." The word came out hard. "Don't make meaning from her terror. Don't turn her hell into metaphor."

"I'm not making meaning. I'm finding what already exists."

The last students had left—Russians, Americans, Israelis. They'd looked at him and known. Everyone recognized someone who'd been south.

Rabbi Levi locked the door. "Privacy for this. The Zohar calls it dangerous knowledge. Not wrong, but easily misunderstood."

He pulled a volume from the shelf—cracked binding, brown pages.

"You asked how God allows evil." The rabbi opened to a marked page. "Wrong question. The question is: what is evil for?"

"For?" Ethan's voice cracked. "Murder has purpose? Rape has function?"

The rabbi drew circles connected by lines on paper. The Tree of Life. Then another beside it—mirror image but wrong, like reflection in dark water.

"The Sitra Achra. The Other Side. Not opposite of holiness, but its concealment."

The lamp flickered once.

"Ein Sof contracted itself. Tzimtzum. God withdrew to create space. In that absence, something else became possible."

"Evil."

"The possibility of choosing evil. Without that, no free will. Without free will, no love."

Ethan stared at the Hebrew text. The letters swam. "This is just—philosophy. Theory. Those people are still dead."

"Yes. They are." The rabbi's voice was quiet. "Philosophy doesn't bring them back. But maybe it keeps us from joining them. In despair, I mean."

The door opened—Sera with her own key. She looked between them, understood.

"The Other Side," she said, not a question.

"He's been there. He needs a map to return."

She sat beside him. Jerusalem winter clung to her coat.

"I studied this after my brother." She touched the diagram. "Suicide. Didn't make it easier. Made it bearable."

"How?"

"The shells crack. Every mitzvah gathers sparks from darkness."

"That sounds like bullshit," Ethan said.

"Maybe it is." Sera touched his arm. "But it's the only bullshit that got me out of bed for two years."

The rabbi turned to another page. "Try reading this anyway."

The Hebrew somehow made sense:

"The Other Side feeds on judgment without mercy. Grows strong on separation. Thrives where divine image is forgotten. Cannot create, only distort. Cannot love, only possess. Cannot endure, only destroy until it destroys itself."

"October 7th was the Other Side showing its face." Rabbi Levi gestured toward the window. "But look—Jews returning from everywhere."

"That doesn't justify—"

"Nothing justifies what happened. Nothing. But maybe—" He paused, searching. "Maybe something can still grow from it. Has to."

The muezzin's call began. Below, someone sang Shabbat melodies early.

"Israel," Rabbi Levi said. "Wrestling with God. Also yashar-El—straight to God. Direct connection despite everything."

"I don't feel connected to anything. Especially not God. If God let October 7th happen, then—"

"Then what? You're angry? Good. Be angry. Argue." The rabbi moved to a cabinet. "That's also connection."

"Connection? I want to punch something."

"That's the klipah. The shell around your soul." He moved to a cabinet, pulled out something wrapped in velvet. "Your tikkun."

Tefillin. Black leather boxes and straps.

"Every morning. Bind them on arm and head. Physical shells containing divine words."

"How does wrapping leather help? I mean, really. What's leather going to do against—" He gestured vaguely south.

The rabbi was quiet for a long moment. "I don't know. Honestly. But my grandfather did it. In the camps, when he could. Made tefillin from scraps." His voice caught. "Didn't save his life. But maybe it saved something else."

Sera stood. "Come. Walk. This knowledge settles too heavy standing still."

They climbed toward the Mount of Olives. Cemetery stones faced the Temple Mount—thousands waiting.

"Your grandmother planted trees on the Mount of Olives. After the war. One for each—well, you know."

"How do you know that?"

"Someone told me once. Maybe it was her, maybe someone who knew her. Memory gets fuzzy." He shrugged. "Does it matter? She planted them. They're still growing."

"Why would I go back to Be'eri?"

"Because you kept that child's drawing." He looked at Ethan's jacket pocket. "Am I right?"

They walked back through shuttered markets, late-night learning spilling from yeshiva windows.

At the study, Sera handed him the velvet bag. "Tomorrow morning. 7:18."

"Is it hard to put on?"

"The physical part? No. Kids learn it. But getting up at 7:18 every morning, believing it matters when the news is full of—" She shrugged. "That's the hard part."

Rabbi Levi paused at his door. "Look, I don't understand half of what I'm telling you. The Zohar, the klipot—it's all theory until you try to live it." He rubbed his forehead. "My wife thinks I'm crazy, spending so much time on this. But what else do we have? Just do it. The doing might teach us something."

Ethan walked home alone, tefillin in one pocket, the folded drawing in another—crayon flaking where he'd creased it. Jerusalem at midnight: soldier checking his phone, Arabic radio from a taxi, someone practicing violin.

In his pocket, the child's drawing—stick figures still holding hands. Tomorrow he would try. His grandmother's spoon was in a museum now. Her trees still grew in the Carmel Forest.

A yahrzeit candle flickered in a window. His grandmother never lit them—"The dead don't need candles. They need trees."

Seventeen trees. They survived the 2010 fire. Still growing.

Something shifted in his chest. Not healing—too soon. But possibility.

The Other Side was real.

So was this side.

He set his phone alarm for 7:18. Then deleted it. Set it again.

In one pocket, tefillin. In the other, the child's drawing—crayon flaking where he'd folded it.

Maybe he would try tomorrow. Maybe the leather straps would mean something. Maybe they were just leather.

His grandmother had planted trees with a spoon. That seemed impossible too.

He left the alarm set. Whether he'd wake up was another question.
