# Chapter 18: The Other Side of Evil

"After what you've seen," the rabbi said, "you need to understand where evil comes from."

December evening in Jerusalem, the city's stones holding winter cold like memory, and Ethan sat in Rabbi Levi Ben-David's study still carrying the Negev dust in his clothes, the smell of char and memorial candles in his hair, the weight of witnessed destruction in his chest where breathing had become something he had to remember to do. Three days since the southern desert. Three days since Kibbutz Be'eri. Three days since standing at the Nova festival grounds where young people had danced until death arrived with the sunrise. Three days, and he hadn't slept more than fragments, hadn't eaten more than necessity, hadn't spoken more than single words to Sera who understood that some silences needed space to become language.

The rabbi's study felt different tonight—darker despite the same warm lamp, colder despite the same radiator ticking its metallic prayer. Or maybe Ethan was different, carrying darkness from the desert that made every light seem dimmer, every warmth seem distant, every prayer seem like words thrown against an indifferent sky.

"Sit," Rabbi Levi said, his voice carrying the particular gentleness reserved for the walking wounded. "First tea, then Torah. First comfort, then comprehension."

Ethan's hands shook holding the glass cup—mint tea, too sweet, the Palestinian glass-seller's pattern etched in the sides catching light like fragments of something broken that still remembered wholeness. Through the study window, the Old City walls glowed golden in winter sunset, beautiful and ancient and indifferent to the tremor in his fingers, the images he couldn't unsee, the questions that had no grammar in any language he knew.

"I keep thinking about the girl," Ethan heard himself say, the words emerging without decision. "The one hiding in the safe room for seven hours. Listening to them in her house. Listening to them kill her parents. Seven hours."

The rabbi's eyes—brown like earth, like comfort, like graves—held Ethan's shaking. "Seven," he repeated. "The number of completion. Sometimes what completes us is surviving what should have destroyed us."

"Don't." The word came out harder than Ethan intended. "Don't make meaning from her terror. Don't turn her hell into metaphor."

"I'm not making meaning, Ethan Israel. I'm finding the meaning that already exists. There's a difference."

Other students were leaving as Ethan had arrived—Russians, Americans, Israelis, gathering coats and scarves, their Thursday night Kabbalah class ending just as Ethan's darker education was beginning. They'd looked at him with recognition—everyone knew the look of someone who'd been south, who'd seen the sites, who'd returned carrying questions that threatened faith more than any philosophy ever could.

Rabbi Levi waited until the last student left, then locked the door. "Privacy for this conversation. What we discuss tonight, the Zohar calls dangerous knowledge. Not because it's wrong, but because it's easily misunderstood."

He pulled a volume from the shelf—ancient binding, pages brown like bread, like time, like the color of burned things before they become ash. The Zohar. The Book of Splendor. Ethan had heard of it, the way secular Jews heard of things—distant, academic, irrelevant until suddenly it wasn't.

"You asked me once how God allows evil," the rabbi began, opening to a page marked with a ribbon red like wine, like blood, like the thread that connected all Jewish learning to its source. "Wrong question. The question is: what is evil for?"

"For?" Ethan's voice cracked on the single syllable. "Murder has a purpose? Rape has a function? Burning families alive serves some divine plan?"

The rabbi drew something on a piece of paper—circles connected by lines, Hebrew letters at each junction. The Tree of Life, Ethan recognized from his grandmother's books, though he'd never understood what it meant beyond decoration, mystical wallpaper for the spiritually inclined.

"Look," Rabbi Levi said, then drew another tree beside it, mirror image but somehow wrong, like a reflection in dark water. "The Sitra Achra. The Other Side. Not the opposite of holiness, but its concealment."

The room grew colder, or seemed to. The lamp flickered once, steadied. Somewhere in the building, a door slammed, though no wind blew through Jerusalem tonight.

"In the beginning," the rabbi continued, his voice dropping to the register of secrets, "Ein Sof—the Infinite—contracted itself. Tzimtzum, we call it. God withdrew to create space for creation. But in that space, in that absence, something else became possible."

"Evil."

"Not evil. The possibility of evil. The possibility of choosing evil. Without that possibility, there's no free will. Without free will, there's no love. Without love, creation has no purpose."

Ethan wanted to argue, wanted to throw the books across the room, wanted to scream that philosophy meant nothing next to a child's last terror, but something in the rabbi's voice held him—not comfort but comprehension, not answers but architecture for questions that threatened to collapse everything.

"The Zohar teaches about klipot," Rabbi Levi continued, drawing shells around the dark tree. "Shells. Husks. Evil isn't a thing itself but a shell around holiness, hiding divine light. Like depression—" he looked directly at Ethan, "—was a shell around your soul, hiding your light from yourself."

"My depression isn't comparable to murder."

"No. But the structure is the same. Concealment. The hiding of what should shine. Your grandmother—" the rabbi paused, seemed to consider, continued, "—she knew about shells. She survived the ultimate klipah, the absolute concealment of divine image in human beings. And she chose to keep light alive anyway."

The door opened though it was locked—Sera entered carrying her own key, her own knowledge, her own weight from working with October 7th survivors. She looked between them, understood immediately what lesson was being taught, what medicine was being administered to wounds that wouldn't heal with time alone.

"You're teaching him about the Other Side," she said, not a question.

"He's been there," Rabbi Levi replied. "He needs a map to return."

She sat beside Ethan, close enough that he could feel her warmth, far enough that he could maintain his careful control. She smelled like Jerusalem winter—stone and rain and something burning somewhere, always something burning in this city of sacrifices.

"I studied this after my brother died," she said quietly. "Suicide. The ultimate klipah—the soul hiding from itself so completely it chooses unbeing." She touched the diagram the rabbi had drawn. "It didn't make it easier. But it made it bearable."

"How?" Ethan asked.

"Because evil has an expiration date. The shells crack. The light escapes. Every mitzvah—every act of connection—gathers the sparks hidden in darkness. We're not fighting evil. We're liberating light."

The rabbi opened the Zohar to another page, Hebrew letters swimming across parchment like code, like music, like the architecture of reality itself. "Read this," he said to Ethan.

"I can't read Hebrew that complex."

"Try."

Ethan looked at the page, expected incomprehension, found instead that words emerged, not in translation but in understanding, as if the language bypassed his brain and spoke directly to whatever part of him remembered what he'd never learned:

"The Other Side feeds on judgment without mercy. It grows strong on separation. It thrives where divine image is forgotten. But it cannot create, only distort. Cannot love, only possess. Cannot endure, only destroy until it destroys itself."

"October 7th," Rabbi Levi said softly, "was the Other Side showing its face. Pure destruction. Pure concealment of divine image. But look what happened after—" He gestured toward the window where Jerusalem spread in darkness punctuated by lights. "Jews returning. Connection strengthening. Light gathering from every corner of exile. The shells cracked, and revelation poured through."

"That doesn't justify—"

"Nothing justifies. But everything serves. Even the Other Side serves the One Side, though it doesn't know it. Every evil contains the seeds of its own transformation."

Ethan's phone buzzed—18:36, the numbers meaning nothing and everything, patterns he was learning to see but not yet understand. Through the window, the muezzin's call to prayer began, while below in the Jewish Quarter someone sang Shabbat melodies though Friday was tomorrow, and church bells rang from the Christian Quarter marking hours that belonged to no one and everyone.

"Your middle name," Rabbi Levi said suddenly. "Israel. One who wrestles with God. You're wrestling with the worst question—how can there be a good God in a world of evil? But the name also means yashar-El. Straight to God. Direct connection despite everything. Because of everything."

"I don't feel connected to anything."

"That's the klipah talking. The shell around your soul, cracked but not yet fallen away." The rabbi stood, moved to a cabinet, pulled out something wrapped in velvet. "Your assignment. Your specific tikkun."

He unwrapped it—a pair of tefillin, phylacteries, black leather boxes and straps that religious Jews wore during morning prayers. Ethan had seen them, never worn them, never understood them beyond costume, beyond tradition, beyond things that separated Jews from the world.

"Every morning," Rabbi Levi said. "Bind them on your arm and head. Physical shells containing divine words. The opposite of klipot—instead of shells hiding light, shells revealing it."

"I don't know how—"

"Sera will teach you. The practice matters more than perfection. The binding matters more than belief."

"I saw evil," Ethan said, the words pulled from somewhere deeper than thought. "Real evil. Not metaphorical. Not philosophical. Bodies burned beyond recognition. Families destroyed for the joy of destroying. How does wrapping leather straps help that?"

The rabbi's eyes filled with something—not tears but the space where tears would be if tears were enough. "Because every morning you'll bind divine words to your body. You'll inscribe connection on flesh that wants to forget. You'll choose the mitzvah, and the mitzvah will choose you back. And slowly, maybe, the shells will crack enough for light to enter. For you to enter your own light."

Sera stood. "Come. We need air. We need to walk. We need to move or this knowledge will settle too heavy."

They left together, the three of them, walking through Jerusalem streets where every stone held memory of destruction and rebuilding, where Jewish and Arab vendors sold their wares side by side during the day and retreated to their separate worlds at night, where the divine and the demonic danced their eternal dance in alleyways older than memory.

They climbed toward the Mount of Olives, the city spreading below them—golden dome, church spires, synagogue windows, all of it beautiful and terrible and irreducibly complex. The cemetery stretched in moonlight, thousands of graves facing the Temple Mount, waiting for resurrection or just for morning, it didn't matter which.

"Here," Rabbi Levi said, gesturing at the view, "is where good and evil meet. Where Isaac was almost sacrificed. Where the Temple stood and fell and stood and fell. Where Muhammad ascended and Jesus wept and David danced. Every tradition. Every revelation. Every concealment."

"What am I supposed to do with this?" Ethan asked. "This knowledge about shells and sparks and Other Sides? How does it help those families in Be'eri? How does it resurrect the dancers at Nova?"

"It doesn't," Sera said. "Nothing resurrects the dead except the dead themselves, if you believe in that. But it might resurrect you. The you that died when you saw what you saw. The you that needs to live anyway, to choose anyway, to bind tefillin tomorrow morning anyway."

The wind picked up, carrying scents of za'atar and garbage, incense and cigarettes, all of Jerusalem's contradictions made olfactory. Below them, memorial candles flickered in windows—one, ten, hundreds, each one a small rebellion against darkness, each one gathering sparks as the rabbi had said, though whether that was truth or necessary fiction Ethan couldn't tell and was learning not to need to know.

"Your grandmother," Rabbi Levi said quietly, "lost everyone in the camps. Parents, siblings, cousins. An entire universe of connection, destroyed. And she came here, to this land, and planted trees. Literal trees. I have the certificates—Jewish National Fund, 1952. Six million trees she pledged to plant, though she only managed thousands. Each one a gathering of sparks. Each one a crack in the shell."

"You knew her?"

"I know everyone who plants trees after witnessing the forest burn. They're all the same soul, just wearing different faces." He pulled something from his pocket—a small stone, smooth, ordinary. "From the Kotel. The Western Wall. Put it on a grave when you visit Be'eri again."

"Why would I go back?"

"Because that's where the shells are thickest. That's where the sparks need gathering most. That's where your specific tikkun waits—not the general repair of the world, but the particular repair that has your name on it, that only you can perform."

They walked back through the Arab Quarter, shuttered shops and suspicious eyes, then through the Jewish Quarter where late-night learning spilled from yeshiva windows, then through the Armenian Quarter silent and strange, then through the Christian Quarter where pilgrims slept in hostels dreaming of holiness.

At the rabbi's study, Sera handed Ethan the tefillin in their velvet bag. "Tomorrow morning. Seven-eighteen, your wake-up time. I'll come and show you. It's strange at first, binding yourself. But sometimes binding is the only freedom—choosing your chains instead of wearing the ones chosen for you."

"Is that Kabbalah?"

"That's life. Kabbalah just gives it vocabulary."

Rabbi Levi unlocked his door, paused. "One more thing. The Zohar says evil can only exist in the lower worlds. In the higher worlds, the divine light is too strong. So when you feel the darkness winning, remember—it only wins here, in this world, temporarily. In the world of truth, it has no power."

"But we live here."

"Yes. That's why we need the mitzvot. They're not rules—they're technologies for bringing higher light into lower darkness. Every Shabbat candle, every blessing, every act of conscious connection. You don't have to believe it. Just do it. The doing creates the belief, not the other way around."

Ethan walked home alone, the tefillin bag heavy in his pocket though it weighed almost nothing. Jerusalem at midnight was a different city—cats and wind and the occasional soldier, prayers seeping through windows in three languages, four, five, all the tongues humanity used to wrestle with the unnamed.

His phone showed 11:36—again the doubled eighteen, chai times two, life insisting on itself even in his pocket where he carried the weight of witnessed death. Tomorrow he would bind leather straps to his arm and head, performing a ritual he didn't understand for a God he wasn't sure existed, gathering sparks he couldn't see from shells he could only feel.

But tonight he walked through Jerusalem carrying new vocabulary for ancient wounds—Sitra Achra, the Other Side that was really the same side in disguise; klipot, the shells that preserved light by hiding it; tikkun, the repair that was really revelation, the uncovering of what was always whole beneath the appearance of breaking.

A memorial candle flickered in a window he passed—someone's yahrzeit, someone's annual remembering. The flame leaned toward him as he walked by, or seemed to, the way flames do when observed by those learning to see signs, learning to read the universe's handwriting, learning that evil was real but not true, temporary but not terminal, powerful but not permanent.

His grandmother had planted trees after watching forests burn.

Tomorrow, he would bind words to his body after seeing bodies destroyed for words—Jewish words, Jewish bodies, the eternal formula for the world's oldest hatred.

But tonight, walking through Jerusalem where David danced and Jesus wept and Muhammad ascended and October 7th survivors tried to sleep, Ethan felt something crack in his chest—not breaking but breaking open, not shattering but letting light through the shatter, not healing but allowing healing's possibility.

The Other Side was real.

But so was this side.

And tomorrow morning at 7:18, he would choose which side to bind himself to, one leather strap at a time, one spark gathered from darkness, one mitzvah pulling light from the deepest shells, the thickest klipot, the Other Side that served the One Side without knowing it, without meaning to, but serving nonetheless, the way evil always serves good eventually, the way darkness makes light visible, the way October 7th had cracked Ethan's shell so thoroughly that something new could enter, something old could return, something eternal could remember itself through his remembering.

Rabbi Levi's words echoed: "You're not fighting evil. You're liberating light."

In his pocket, the tefillin waited, patient as tradition, older than his questions, simpler than theology—just leather and words and the technology of binding, the choice to wrap himself in something beyond himself, to literally inscribe connection on skin that had touched October's ground, that had felt evil's reality, that would tomorrow morning choose its opposite.

Not because he understood.

But because understanding wasn't the point.

The point was the choosing.

The point was the binding.

The point was gathering sparks from darkness, one mitzvah at a time, one morning at a time, one leather strap wrapped around an arm that had reached toward Be'eri's ashes and pulled back holding nothing but questions that now, finally, had not answers but a framework for surviving the absence of answers.

The Sitra Achra.

The Other Side.

Which was really this side wearing the mask of separation, the disguise of disconnection, the shells that hid light so completely that finding it again felt like victory.

Tomorrow, 7:18.

Tefillin.

The beginning of his specific tikkun, his particular repair, his grandmother's trees growing through his choosing, one mitzvah at a time in a world where evil was real but not true.

Not true.

Not eternally true.

Just true enough to require choosing its opposite, binding its opposite, becoming its opposite through the simple technology of wrapping leather straps around flesh and deciding that connection mattered more than comprehension.

The shells would crack.

The light would emerge.

Not because he believed it.

But because he would do it anyway.

And the doing would teach him what believing meant.
