# Chapter 7: The Breaking News

The notification popped up at 10:47 AM, innocent as a weather alert.

Ethan had woken late on Saturday morning, October 7th—Simchat Torah, though he wouldn't realize the significance until later—head thick from Friday night drinks at another Williamsburg bar where everyone talked about their therapists and startup pivots while the world turned outside their awareness. His phone face-down on the nightstand, he'd managed three full minutes of consciousness before reaching for it—a personal record of delayed digital dependence he'd immediately undone by opening Twitter, the muscle memory stronger than any intention to start his mornings differently.

Coffee first, he'd told himself, padding to the kitchen in yesterday's t-shirt, the automatic pour-over ritual buying him five more minutes of pretense that this Saturday would be different from every other Saturday. Ethiopian single origin, eighteen dollars a bag, ground to the precise coarseness his expensive burr grinder recommended for optimal extraction. The smell hit him wrong—too bitter, too much like emergency.

Standing at his kitchen counter, he'd scrolled through the usual—someone's sourdough success, someone's marathon training, someone's baby announcement, the infinite loop of other people's lives looking lived. His thumb moved automatically, algorithmically trained to seek the next dopamine hit of outrage or envy or whatever feeling could penetrate the Wellbutrin haze.

The first headline hadn't registered.

Hamas. Israel. Attack. Words that floated past like every other crisis, every other somewhere-else catastrophe he'd scroll past on his way to checking his matches on Hinge.

Then the videos started.

Not the polished news footage with graphics and talking heads, but raw phone recordings—shaky, vertical, real. The sound hit him first. Sirens he'd never heard but somehow recognized in his bones. Screaming in Hebrew that needed no translation. Then the images: bodies, blood, a child's shoe abandoned in dust.

Ethan set his coffee down. His hand was shaking.

Refresh. "Hundreds dead" became "massacre" became numbers climbing like a slot machine of horror—except every number was a person, and something inside Ethan was cracking like ice over deep water.

A video autoplayed: a young woman at a music festival, her last Instagram story. She was dancing, laughing, alive in the way only twenty-somethings at sunrise can be alive. The timestamp: 6:29 AM Israel time. The caption: "Perfect morning." The next video: the same field, smoke and running and sounds that shouldn't exist in the same universe as dancing.

Ethan made it to the bathroom just in time. The vomit came sudden and violent, his body rejecting not just last night's whiskey but something deeper—some fundamental wrongness that his stomach recognized before his mind could process it. He gripped the toilet rim, his whole body shaking, and heard himself make a sound he'd never made before—something between a sob and a scream, primal and embarrassing and absolutely necessary.

His phone buzzed on the bathroom floor where he'd dropped it. Mom calling. He couldn't. Not yet. Not with his mouth tasting of bile and his hands still shaking and this feeling like something was being torn out of him by the roots.

Back in the living room, daylight looked wrong through his windows—too bright, too normal, too much like any other Saturday while his phone showed him hell in real-time. He picked it up again, unable to stop, each scroll making him sicker but stopping felt like abandonment, like if he looked away it would somehow be worse, though worse seemed impossible until the next video proved it wasn't.

Group chats exploding now. Work Slack full of "This is horrible" with emojis that seemed obscene. College WhatsApp already fracturing into positions while the death count climbed.

Then Aaron's text, separate from the group: "Have you seen Gideon Levy's piece on this?"

Ethan stared at the message. An op-ed reference. While people were still dying, Aaron was already curating reading lists. Another text: "Important thread here on historical precedents." A link. Another link. Another: "My Palestinian client just sent me this perspective."

Each message felt like a slap. Ethan typed: "People are being slaughtered right now." Deleted it. Typed: "Stop making this about your politics." Deleted it. Typed: "Why aren't you crying?" Deleted that too.

His chest felt too tight, like his ribs were crushing inward. He called his parents—needed to hear voices that knew him before he knew himself. His mother answered on the first ring.

"Ethan? Oh thank God. Have you seen—"

"Mom." The word came out broken, childlike. "Mom, I can't—I don't—"

"I know, honey. I know."

But she didn't know. Neither did he. How could his body be responding like this to deaths six thousand miles away? He didn't know anyone in Israel. Had never been. Had spent years carefully not caring about that particular piece of land and its particular problems. Yet here he was, hyperventilating on his expensive couch, feeling like someone had reached into his chest and grabbed something vital, something he didn't know was there until it was being ripped away.

"Your grandmother," his mother was saying, "she would have been heartbroken. Her cousins... some of their families stayed. After the war. They built lives there."

Cousins he'd never known existed. Family trees he'd never climbed. Connections his parents had pruned in their careful American assimilation, now flooding back like blood returning to a sleeping limb.

"I have to go," he managed.

"Ethan—"

He hung up and immediately felt worse. His phone showed 613 unread messages across all platforms—that number again, following him even through catastrophe, the commandments he'd never learned calling out from notification badges.

Twitter was a massacre of its own—everyone performing their politics while bodies were still warm. The same events refracted through infinite lenses until people were dead and that was the only truth that mattered.

A video surfaced that broke through his last defense. A child, couldn't be more than five, calling "Ima! Ima!" through smoke and chaos. Ima—mommy in Hebrew, a word Ethan didn't know he knew until he heard it and felt it land like a stone in his chest. The child's voice pure terror, pure need, pure human suffering that predated politics and survived all analysis.

Ethan heard himself sobbing—ugly, body-shaking sobs that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than his own life, inherited grief activating like a sleeper cell in his DNA. His mouth moved without permission, forming words he didn't know: "Baruch Dayan HaEmet."

He stopped, shocked by his own voice. What had he just said? The words felt ancient in his mouth, older than him, older than his forgetting. Hebrew, definitely Hebrew, but from where? From when? His grandmother's funeral—yes, people had said this. The rabbi had said this. But why was he saying it now, alone in his Brooklyn apartment, watching strangers die on his phone?

The sun was setting now, though he hadn't noticed the day passing. Time had become elastic, stretching and compressing—hours of scrolling felt like minutes, seconds of certain videos felt like forever. The apartment dark except for his phone's glow, that modern campfire around which he huddled alone, watching civilization burn.

Aaron's texts kept coming: "Just spoke to my colleague at B'Tselem." "Reading Judith Butler on grievable lives." "Have you seen this Democracy Now segment?"

Ethan typed: "Children are dead." Sent it. 

The three dots appeared and disappeared. Finally: "I know. It's complex. I'm just trying to understand. My grandmother would have understood the fear."

True. Relevant. And somehow exactly wrong for this moment when Ethan's body was teaching him something his mind had forgotten—that some pain is personal even when it shouldn't be, that some connections survive all attempts at severing, that somewhere in his DNA was a memory of other violence, other children calling for mothers who wouldn't come, other Sabbaths turned into mourning.

His laptop sat open on the coffee table, cursor blinking in a search bar where he'd typed "synagogues near me" without remembering doing it. The results showed seven within walking distance—Reformed, Conservative, Orthodox, Chabad, varieties of something he'd never understood the differences between. Each website showing service times, upcoming events, communities gathering for precisely this—collective grief, collective memory, collective something he'd spent his entire adult life avoiding.

He closed the laptop. Opened it again. Closed it.

Outside, Brooklyn went on with its Saturday night as if the world hadn't shifted on its axis. Through his window, he could see people heading to dinner, to parties, to dates that would end in other apartments with other confusions. Normal life continuing its normal course while his phone showed him children's bodies and his grandmother's language emerged from his mouth uninvited and everything he'd thought he knew about himself was proving to be construction paper in a thunderstorm.

His phone buzzed: his mother again. He let it ring through to voicemail, then played it immediately: "Just wanted to know you're okay. Dad and I are watching the news. It's..." Her voice cracked. "Call us when you can."

Seven eighteen PM on his phone when he noticed the time. That number again, appearing at this moment of rupture like something saying *pay attention, this matters, you matter.*

The group chat: "Anyone want to grab a drink? I can't watch anymore alone." "My cousin's in Tel Aviv." Messages layering—performance and genuine feeling, everyone trying to find words for something that broke language.

Ethan found himself at his window, looking out at Brooklyn, the lights in other apartments like yahrzeit candles nobody had lit on purpose. Somewhere out there were others feeling this same ancestral activation, this same unexpected grief, this same confusion about why it hurt so much when it wasn't supposed to hurt at all.

His reflection in the dark window showed a face he didn't recognize—puffy from crying, drawn with exhaustion, aged ten years in ten hours. Behind that face, his grandmother's genetics looking back at him, the features that had survived pogrom and migration, assimilation and forgetting, everything that had brought him to this moment of standing in a Brooklyn apartment crying for strangers who weren't strangers, who were family he'd never met, who were him in some fundamental way he'd spent thirty-three years denying.

He opened his laptop again, the search still there: "synagogues near me." This time he clicked on one—Congregation Beth Shalom, Upper West Side. Reformed, it said. Welcoming, it said. Friday night services at 7:18 PM—that time again, calling to him, following him, finding him even in his emptiest spaces.

He closed the laptop.

Opened it again.

Closed it.

Outside, October 7th was becoming October 8th. In this apartment, in this body that had surprised him with its capacity for ancient grief, something was ending and something else was beginning.

He felt the weight of his hidden middle name: Israel. Suddenly less burden than calling.

Ethan set down the laptop and picked up his phone. His mother answered immediately.

"Mom," he said, and his voice sounded different, older, younger, broken and beginning to reform. "Mom, I think I need to go to synagogue."

Silence on the line, but warm silence, full silence, the kind that held space for transformation.

"Your grandmother," she said finally, "would be so—" She stopped, started again. "She kept asking, near the end. If you ever went. If you remembered the prayers. I didn't know what to tell her."

"I don't remember them," Ethan admitted. "I don't remember anything."

A long pause. "I don't either, honey. Not really. But maybe—" Her voice was uncertain. "Maybe that's okay. Maybe that's where you start."

After they hung up, Ethan sat in his dark apartment, phone still showing the endless scroll of horror and response, but something had shifted. The crack in his chest had widened enough to let something in—light maybe, or just the possibility of light, the first understanding that breaking might be the beginning of healing, that exile might be the first step toward return.

He opened his laptop one more time. Congregation Beth Shalom. Vigil tomorrow night, October 8th. All welcome. Come as you are.

The words blurred with tears he didn't try to stop.

He closed the laptop. Walked to his dresser and pulled out the only dress shirt he owned—wrinkled but clean. Laid it on the bed next to pants that might pass for respectful.

His reflection in the dark window showed his grandmother's features looking back—the architecture of survival written in bone.

Tomorrow, he would go.
