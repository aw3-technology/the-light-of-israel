# Chapter 27: Build and Be Built

Learning Hebrew at thirty-three felt like archaeological excavation of self—each new word not learned but remembered, each grammatical structure not foreign but forgotten, my tongue struggling to pronounce what my soul had always known.

July in Jerusalem, the heat different from Brooklyn summer—dry, ancient, pressing down like hands in blessing or burden depending on the day. Seven months since his return from the journey through exile, seven months of Sera's apartment becoming theirs, seven months of tourist visa ticking toward expiration while he navigated the byzantine process of becoming Israeli, of transforming return into remaining.

The Ulpan classroom at eight in the morning already stifling, windows open to catch breeze that never came, twenty-three new immigrants bent over Hebrew worksheets like prayer books, conjugating verbs that refused to follow patterns, wrestling with a language that read backward and thought in circles and somehow made more sense than English when it came to describing the soul.

"Ani boneh," Ethan repeated, the verb for building. "I build. Atah boneh. You build. Hu boneh. He builds."

Beside him, Natasha from Moscow—former programmer, now cleaning offices while her computer science degree gathered dust in some Ministry office waiting for recognition—corrected his pronunciation. "Boneh. From the throat. Like you're pulling stones from inside."

Behind them, Philippe from Lyon—cardiologist in France, nothing here yet—muttered the same words with his French accent making Hebrew sound like wine being poured. Everyone building language, building lives, building something from the demolition of everything they'd been before.

The teacher, Orna—Israeli born, impatient with immigrant stammering, kind in the way Israelis were kind, roughly, without sentiment—wrote on the board: "אני בונה את עצמי." I build myself.

"This is reflective verb," she said in Hebrew slow enough for them to catch. "Not just building. Building the self. Building identity. You understand?"

They understood. Everyone in the room had unmade themselves to be here. Former doctors, lawyers, professors, tech workers—now children again, learning to speak, learning to read, learning to think in a language that their ancestors had spoken but America or Russia or France had trained out of them, generation by generation until only fragments remained, holiday words, grandmother prayers, the sounds but not the meaning.

"Ethan," Orna called. "Tell us in Hebrew what you're building."

He stood, the words forming slowly, like lifting stones. "Ani boneh... bayit. Ani boneh... mishpacha. Ani boneh..." He stopped, searched for the word. "Life. How do you say life?"

"Chayim," the class responded in unison. They all knew that one. L'chayim. To life. The toast that survived even the most thorough assimilation.

"Ani boneh chayim chadashim." I build new life.

"Tov me'od," Orna said. Very good. But her eyes said more—she'd seen thousands like him, Americans especially, coming with romantic ideas about return, most leaving when romance met reality, when building meant actual construction, actual struggle, actual transformation of self that hurt more than anyone expected.

Break time, the immigrants scattered to the courtyard, Russian with Russian, French with French, Americans finding each other like lost tribes. But Ethan sat with Sera, who'd come to pick him up, her presence grounding him when Hebrew made his brain feel like it was melting.

"How was class?" she asked in English, merciful.

"My brain hurts. Everything backward. Verbs don't make sense."

"You're thinking in English still. Stop translating. Let Hebrew think for you."

"How do I let a language think for me?"

She smiled, that particular smile that had been different lately, carrying secret knowledge. "The same way you let Israel think for you. Surrender. Stop fighting. Become."

Her hand went to her stomach, unconscious gesture he'd noticed her doing more often. Something shifted in Ethan's chest—recognition before knowledge, body understanding before mind.

"Sera?"

"I was waiting. To be sure. To find the right words." She switched to Hebrew, slow, careful, making sure he understood. "Ani beherayon." I am pregnant.

The courtyard sounds faded—Russian arguments, French complaints, Arabic from the construction site next door where they were building luxury apartments for Jews on land that had ten thousand years of competing claims. All of it became distant, irrelevant against the sound of future arriving in Hebrew words his brain translated slow as archaeology: pregnant, carrying, creating life.

"When?" *Joy and terror in equal measure. A baby. My baby. Our baby. What if I'm not ready? What if we can't afford—*

"Hanukkah. That first week you were back." Her smile was tired but radiant. "The holiday of light. We received more than we knew."

His phone buzzed—his parents, their daily check-in since he'd told them about staying, their confusion and concern transmitted through carefully worded texts that avoided saying what they really thought: that he'd lost his mind, that he was throwing away his American life for a country they saw only through CNN's lens, through Palestinian protests at Columbia, through their own parents' stories of fleeing Europe, not understanding why anyone would flee toward instead of away.

"I need a job," he heard himself say. "A real job. The tourist visa expires in two weeks. We need to—" He stopped. "Wait. We?"

"We," she confirmed. "If you want. If you're staying. Really staying, not just—"

"I'm staying."

The words came out certain though nothing was certain, though he had six thousand dollars left from his savings, though his Hebrew was broken, though the Ministry of Interior treated his aliyah application like a crime he was trying to commit against bureaucracy itself.

"Then we need to make it official," she said. "Not the romantic part. The practical part. You need a work visa at least, better to start the aliyah process properly. My cousin works at Misrad HaPnim." Ministry of Interior. "She says bring everything. Every document. Birth certificate, parents' birth certificates, grandparents' death certificates, everything proving you're Jewish enough to return."

Jewish enough. The phrase caught in his throat. His grandmother would have laughed. Or cried. Or both. Jewish enough for the Nazis to kill, now needing to prove Jewish enough for Israel to accept.

That afternoon, Ethan came home early to find Sera on the living room floor, hundreds of photographs spread around her like a paper timeline. She didn't look up when he entered, just kept arranging and rearranging photos in perfect chronological order.

"What are you doing?" he asked softly.

"Michal always said photos steal souls. I told her that was superstitious bullshit." Her voice was distant, focused on the task. "Now I'm trying to give her soul back, piece by piece. Like... like reassembly."

Ethan noticed now—all the photos were of the same woman. Dark-haired, laughing in most of them. Young.

Sera held up a photo of teenage Michal laughing at some long-ago beach. "I have seventeen years of her in here. If I put them in perfect order, maybe I can find the moment her story was supposed to continue. Maybe I can photograph the ending she deserved. Every life is a series of exposures—some overexposed in harsh light, some underexposed in shadow. October 7th was like someone burning the negatives before the film could be developed."

"She was at Nova," Sera added quietly. "The festival. We were supposed to go together but I had a wedding to shoot. She went alone. Danced alone. Died alone while I was photographing someone else's happiness."

The photos kept spreading, widening circles of memory. Ethan sat carefully at the edge, not disturbing the pattern.

"This isn't your fault."

"I know. But knowing and feeling are different languages." She finally looked up at him, eyes red but dry. "Sometimes I think that's why I fell for you. Another broken story needing completion. Someone else whose narrative got interrupted by October 7th."

Later, while Sera returned to her counseling work—she counseled October 7th survivors, came home each day carrying their trauma like perfume that wouldn't wash off—Ethan went to the construction site he passed each morning. The foreman, Yossi, looked at his soft hands, his American clothes, his immigrant desperation.

"You ever build anything?"

"No."

"You strong?"

"I can become strong."

"You speak Hebrew?"

"Learning."

Yossi laughed, not unkindly. "Americans. You all come to find yourselves. You know what you find?" He gestured at the site. "Stones are heavy. Sun is hot. Building hurts." He pulled out his phone, showed Ethan a photo—little girl with pigtails blowing out birthday candles. "My granddaughter. Seven years old. Lives in Haifa with my daughter who thinks I'm meshuga for still doing this work. 'Saba,' she tells me, 'you're seventy-two.' But what else am I going to do? Sit and wait to die?"

"I need work."

"Tomorrow, five AM. Bring water. Bring work clothes. Bring humility. I pay cash first month while you sort documents. We'll file a work permit request tied to your temporary residency. After that, official. If you last that long."

He lasted. Every morning, predawn darkness to the site, hands blistering then callousing, back screaming then strengthening, Hebrew improving through construction vocabulary—concrete, rebar, level, plumb, all the words for making things straight and true and permanent. The Palestinians on the crew taught him Arabic curses. The Russians taught him to drink vodka at lunch and still lay bricks straight. Yossi taught him that building was prayer, every wall an argument against impermanence.

"You see?" Yossi pointed at the skyline one morning, Jerusalem spread golden in sunrise. "Every building here is politics. Every stone is history. We build on top of what was, always. Layers and layers. Jewish, Arab, Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Ottoman, British, now us again. Building is how we claim. Building is how we stay."

His parents arrived two weeks later, their visit planned months ago when Ethan was supposed to be returning to Brooklyn, to sanity, to the life they'd built for him through careful assimilation, good schools, right choices. Instead they found their son dark from sun, rough from labor, speaking broken Hebrew to his pregnant girlfriend—not wife, they noted with concern—in a two-room apartment in East Talpiot where the mezuzah was actually touched, actually kissed, actually treated like more than decoration.

"This is what you chose?" His mother's voice cracked. She stood at the window, watching the construction site.

*God, she looks old. When did that happen? I'm breaking her heart.* "Mom, this is what—it chose me."

"Don't be—you're a college graduate. Six-figure salary. You had—"

"I have a future. Just not—" *Not the one you sacrificed for. Not the safe American dream you built for me.* "Not the one you planned."

His father scanned the apartment. "Healthcare?" *Always practical. Always worried.*

"It's free. Universal."

"Security? That stabbing in the Old City—"

"Dad, there was a shooting—in Brooklyn. Yesterday. Three dead." *Why am I being defensive? He's scared. They're both scared.*

They couldn't see it, what he saw. Couldn't feel what had shifted. They saw Israel through American eyes—dangerous, difficult, irrational, foreign. He saw it through eyes that had witnessed October 7th, traveled through exile, returned to find home where home had always been waiting, difficult and dangerous and irrational and his.

Sera made dinner, traditional Shabbat meal though it was Thursday, trying to show them something beyond politics, beyond practicality. His mother helped in the kitchen, pausing to admire the challah Sera had braided, the two women finding careful ground in food preparation, in the universal language of feeding family. His father noticed the mezuzah screws were loose and quietly tightened them while reading the English Jerusalem Post, shaking his head at every article, everything confirming his sense that his son had chosen insanity.

"The pregnancy," his mother said carefully. "When?"

"January. Maybe February."

"You'll come home for—for the birth? American citizenship—"

"No." *Too quick. Too harsh.* "The baby will be Israeli."

The silence that followed had weight, had history, had his grandparents' fleeing and his parents' assimilation and his own return all compressed into the space between words.

His mother reached into her purse, pulled out something wrapped in tissue paper. "I brought these." His grandmother's Shabbat candlesticks, the ones from Poland she'd mentioned in her voicemail months ago. "Your father found them in the attic. Along with her ketubah. And..." She hesitated. "Her diary. From 1948. When Israel..." She couldn't finish.

"When Israel became real," his father said quietly. "She wrote about dancing in the streets of Brooklyn. Crying and dancing." He looked at his son. "I never knew she kept a diary."

"You can't be serious," his father said, changing the subject back, uncomfortable with the emotion.

"I've never been more serious."

"Israeli citizenship means military service. You want your child to—"

"To defend their home? Yes."

"This isn't your home, Ethan. You're American."

"I'm Israeli. Or will be. The paperwork is processing."

His mother crying now, quiet tears that she tried to hide. "We gave you everything. Good schools. Opportunities. Safety. And you choose... this?"

Ethan looked at Sera, who understood without translation, who'd heard this conversation in a dozen variations from a dozen immigrant families, the parents who couldn't understand why their children chose difficulty over ease, meaning over money, belonging over success.

"You gave me everything except—" Ethan stopped, started again. "Everything except a reason. To be Jewish. Beyond just—avoiding antisemitism. Here I don't need to—" *Am I making sense? Do I sound crazy?* "Here, my child will know who they are. Without translation."

"Your child will grow up in a war zone," his father said.

"My child will grow up—" *Home. But what if he's right? What if I'm endangering everything for some fantasy of belonging?* "Home. My child will grow up home."

They left three days later, earlier than planned, the visit cut short by irreconcilable difference, by the chasm between those who saw Israel as last resort and those who saw it as first choice. At the airport, his mother hugged him long, whispered, "When you come to your senses—and you will—we're here. Your room is still—" She stopped. "We're here."

But she was already speaking to someone who didn't exist, the Ethan who might wake up from this dream, might choose ease over meaning, might return to Brooklyn's safety and spiritual emptiness. That Ethan had died somewhere between Be'eri and Berlin, between the Nova festival grounds and the pyramid at Giza. This Ethan, the one building himself along with Jerusalem, was someone she didn't recognize.

The Ministry of Interior, a week later. Five hours of waiting—wrong forms, right forms, missing documents, found documents—the bureaucracy of belonging grinding slow as tectonic plates. The clerk, a Russian immigrant twenty years ago, looked at his papers with the exhaustion of someone who'd processed ten thousand dreams and watched nine thousand fade.

"Parents Jewish?"

"Yes."

"Grandparents?"

"My grandmother was. Holocaust survivor."

"Documents?"

He had them. Death certificate from Long Island. Birth certificate showing maiden name: Rosen. Her parents' names: Abraham and Sarah. The names that had been changed, hidden, Americanized, now excavated for the purpose of return.

"Marriage plans?" She looked at Sera's belly.

"Ken. Yes. We—soon."

"Your Hebrew?"

"Getting better? I hope?"

She almost smiled. "They all say that. Your kids will laugh at your accent." She pushed forms across the desk. "Sign. Hebrew date, not English."

He signed Ethan Israel Stone in Hebrew letters, the script still awkward in his hand but becoming familiar, like wearing his grandfather's clothes that slowly adjusted to his different body.

"Mazal tov," the clerk said, stamping something official. "You're now in the system. Not Israeli yet, but in process. Could take six months, could take two years. Meanwhile, temporary residency. You can work legally. You can build."

Build. The word that had become everything. Building apartments over ancient ground. Building language in rewired brain. Building family in Sera's womb. Building self from demolished certainties.

That evening, Shabbat arriving with Jerusalem's particular Friday magic, the city shutting down and lighting up simultaneously, secular and religious joined in the rhythm of rest whether they admitted it or not. Ethan's hands, rough from the week's labor, lit candles with Sera. The Hebrew blessings came easier now, not from understanding but from repetition, from the body learning what the mind still translated.

"Baruch atah Adonai..." Blessed are you, Lord...

Through the window, construction cranes paused against the skyline, monuments to the endless building, the eternal argument against impermanence that was Jerusalem's deepest nature. Somewhere his parents were flying over the Atlantic, returning to safety, to certainty, to the exile they called home. Somewhere his grandmother's spirit was laughing or crying or both.

"Your hands," Sera said, taking them after the blessing. "They're different."

They were. Calloused, scarred, strong. Builder's hands. Israeli hands. The hands of someone who'd chosen difficulty over ease, meaning over comfort, belonging over success.

"Everything's different," he said in Hebrew, the words coming without translation now, without thought, the language thinking for him as Sera had promised.

"Nachon," she agreed. Correct. "Everything different. Everything beginning."

She guided his rough hands to her belly where something built itself without blueprint, without struggle, with the same certainty that had brought him here, kept him here, transformed him here.

"Names," she said. "If it's a boy?"

*A boy. Will he look like me? Will he sound Israeli? Will my parents ever meet him?* "Something with building. Boneh? Binyamin?"

"From everything," she said. "You came from grandmothers. From October 7th. From Cairo and Berlin and—" She yawned. "All of it led here."

*All of it. Including the fear. Including the doubt. Including the possibility this is all a mistake.*

The muezzin's call to prayer echoed from East Jerusalem, church bells rang from the Christian Quarter, and in their apartment, Jewish life continued its ancient insistence on continuing. Ethan thought of his parents, probably somewhere over Greenland now, discussing their crazy son, their lost son, their son who'd chosen the hard path when easy was available.

They couldn't see what he saw: that easy was actually harder, that safety was actually dangerous, that building in Brooklyn meant nothing compared to building in Jerusalem where every stone was argument, history, future, prayer.

"I need to call Rabbi Levi," Ethan said. "About the wedding. About making this official."

"Tomorrow," Sera said. "After Shabbat. Tonight we just be. Tonight we just build through being."

Outside, Jerusalem settled into its Sabbath quiet, the construction sites dormant, the cranes like sleeping giants against the skyline. But inside, in Sera's womb, in Ethan's transforming consciousness, in the space between them that was becoming family, the building continued.

His phone, set to silent for Shabbat, showed a text from his mother he wouldn't read until tomorrow: "Your father thinks I should let you go. I can't. You're my son. Even this version I don't recognize. When you're ready, we're here."

But he wasn't that son anymore. He was Ethan Israel Stone, building himself in Jerusalem stone by stone, word by word, day by day. His children would be born Israeli. His Hebrew would always carry an accent. His hands would stay rough from building. His parents would never understand.

And that was okay.

That was the price of choosing.

That was the cost of building.

That was the weight of stones that built not just apartments over ancient ground but identity over inherited emptiness, meaning over ease, home over exile.

"Shabbat shalom," Sera said, the words complete, perfect, needing no translation.

"Shabbat shalom," he replied, his Hebrew accent making her smile, his builder's hands holding her carefully, his American past and Israeli future reconciling in this moment of rest between buildings, between languages, between the person he'd been and the person he was becoming, stone by stone, word by word, choice by choice in Jerusalem where everyone was building something from the ruins of something else.

Tomorrow he would return to construction.

Tomorrow he would continue learning Hebrew.

Tomorrow he would plan a wedding, prepare for fatherhood, navigate bureaucracy.

But tonight was Shabbat in Jerusalem.

Outside, the construction cranes stood motionless against the sky, waiting for Sunday. *Will I still be building then? Will the money last? What if the baby comes early?*

He pushed the thoughts away. Shabbat was for rest, not worry.

Though the worry remained, quiet and persistent as Jerusalem stone.
