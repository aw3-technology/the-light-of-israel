# Chapter 27: Build and Be Built

Learning Hebrew at thirty-three felt like archaeological excavation—each new word not learned but remembered, each grammatical structure not foreign but forgotten, his tongue struggling to pronounce what his soul had always known.

July in Jerusalem, the heat different from Brooklyn summer—dry, ancient, pressing down like hands in blessing or burden depending on the day. Seven months since his return from the journey through exile, seven months of Sera's apartment becoming theirs, seven months of navigating the byzantine process of transforming tourist status into temporary residency, then into the long aliyah process that would make him Israeli, of transforming return into remaining.

The Ulpan classroom at eight in the morning already stifling, windows open to catch breeze that never came, twenty-three new immigrants bent over Hebrew worksheets like prayer books, conjugating verbs that refused to follow patterns, wrestling with a language that read backward and thought in circles and somehow made more sense than English when it came to describing the soul.

"Ani boneh," Ethan repeated, the verb for building. "I build. Atah boneh. You build. Hu boneh. He builds."

Beside him, Natasha from Moscow—former cybersecurity specialist, now stocking shelves at Rami Levy while her credentials underwent "evaluation"—corrected his pronunciation. "Boneh. From the throat. Like you're coughing up dust from old buildings."

Behind them, Philippe from Lyon—cardiologist who'd fled rising antisemitism after his hospital parking spot was repeatedly vandalized—muttered the same words with his French accent turning Hebrew into something musical and frustrated. Everyone weaving language, sculpting lives, crafting something from the demolition of everything they'd been before.

The teacher, Orna—born in Haifa, sabra-tough but patient with genuine effort, impatient only with whining—wrote on the board: "אני בונה את עצמי." I build myself.

"This is reflective verb," she said in Hebrew slow enough for them to catch. "Not just constructing. Shaping the self. Forging identity. You understand?"

They understood. Everyone in the room had dismantled themselves to be here. Former doctors, lawyers, professors, tech workers—now apprentices again, learning to speak, learning to read, learning to think in a language that their ancestors had spoken but America or Russia or France had erased, generation by generation until only fragments remained, holiday words, grandmother prayers, the sounds but not the meaning.

"Ethan," Orna called. "Tell us in Hebrew what you're building."

He stood, the words forming slowly, like lifting stones. "Ani boneh... bayit. Ani boneh... mishpacha. Ani boneh..." He stopped, searched for the word. "Life. How do you say life?"

"Chayim," the class responded in unison. They all knew that one. L'chayim. To life. The toast that survived even the most thorough assimilation.

"Ani boneh chayim chadashim." I build new life.

"Tov me'od," Orna said. Very good. But her eyes said more—she'd seen thousands like him, Americans especially, coming with romantic ideas about return, most leaving when romance met reality, when building meant actual construction, actual struggle, actual transformation of self that hurt more than anyone expected.

Break time, the immigrants clustered by shared confusion rather than nationality—Natasha teaching Philippe Russian curse words, Philippe explaining French grammar rules that might help with Hebrew verb patterns, everyone bonding over bureaucratic horror stories. But Ethan sat with Sera, who'd come to pick him up, her presence grounding him when Hebrew made his brain feel like it was melting.

"How was class?" she asked in English, merciful.

"My brain hurts. Everything backward. Verbs don't make sense."

"You're thinking in English still. Stop translating. Let Hebrew think for you."

"How do I let a language think for me?"

She smiled, that particular smile that had been different lately, carrying secret knowledge. "The same way you let Israel think for you. Surrender. Stop fighting. Become."

Her hand went to her stomach, unconscious gesture he'd noticed her doing more often. Something shifted in Ethan's chest—recognition before knowledge, body understanding before mind.

"Sera?"

"I was waiting. To be sure. To find the right words." She switched to Hebrew, slow, careful, making sure he understood. "Ani beherayon." I am pregnant.

The courtyard sounds faded—Russian arguments, French complaints, Arabic from the construction site next door where they were raising luxury apartments for Jews on land that had ten thousand years of competing claims. All of it became distant, irrelevant against the sound of future arriving in Hebrew words his brain translated slow as archaeology: pregnant, carrying, creating life.

"When?" *Joy and terror in equal measure. A baby. My baby. Our baby. What if I'm not ready? What if we can't afford—*

"Hanukkah. That first week you were back." Her smile was tired but radiant. "The holiday of light. We received more than we knew."

His phone buzzed—his parents, their daily check-in since he'd told them about staying, their confusion and concern transmitted through carefully worded texts that avoided saying what they really thought: that he'd lost his mind, that he was throwing away his American life for a country they saw only through CNN's lens, through Palestinian protests at Columbia, through their own parents' stories of fleeing Europe, not understanding why anyone would flee toward instead of away.

"I need a job," he heard himself say. "A real job. My A-1 temp permit needs renewal next month, and they want employment verification for the aliyah application. We need to—" He stopped. "Wait. We?"

"We," she confirmed. "If you want. If you're staying. Really staying, not just—"

"I'm staying."

The words came out certain though nothing was certain, though he had six thousand dollars left from his savings, though his Hebrew was broken, though the Ministry of Interior treated his aliyah application like a crime he was trying to commit against bureaucracy itself.

"Then we need to make it official," she said. "Not the romantic part. The practical part. You need a work visa at least, better to start the aliyah process properly. My cousin works at Misrad HaPnim." Ministry of Interior. "She says bring everything. Every document. Birth certificate, parents' birth certificates, grandparents' death certificates, everything proving you're Jewish enough to return."

Jewish enough. The phrase caught in his throat. His grandmother would have laughed. Or cried. Or both. Jewish enough for the Nazis to kill, now needing to prove Jewish enough for Israel to accept.

That afternoon, Ethan came home early to find Sera on the living room floor, hundreds of photographs spread around her like a paper timeline, her laptop open beside her showing grant application forms. She didn't look up when he entered, just kept arranging and rearranging photos in perfect chronological order.

"What are you doing?" he asked softly.

"Applying for the Herzl Institute fellowship," she said, not looking up. "For documentary projects addressing collective trauma." She held up a photo of teenage Michal laughing at some long-ago beach. "Michal always said photos steal souls. I told her that was superstitious bullshit. Now I'm trying to prove her wrong by giving souls back, piece by piece."

Ethan noticed now—all the photos were of the same woman. Dark-haired, laughing in most of them. Young.

"I have seventeen years of her in here. The fellowship would fund a proper exhibition. 'Interrupted Narratives: Lives Stolen by October 7th.' I'd photograph the places where they should have been—empty wedding venues, vacant apartments, unsent job applications. Show absence as presence." Her voice gained energy. "The gallery director who canceled yesterday? She said showing victims makes audiences uncomfortable. But that's exactly why it needs to be shown."

"She was at Nova," Sera added quietly. "The festival. We were supposed to go together but I had a wedding to shoot. She went alone. Danced alone. Died alone while I was photographing someone else's happiness."

The photos kept spreading, widening circles of memory. Ethan sat carefully at the edge, not disturbing the pattern.

"This isn't your fault."

"I know. But the fellowship deadline is next week. If I get it, I can quit the survivor counseling. Focus on this full-time." She finally looked up at him, eyes red but determined. "Sometimes I think that's why I fell for you. Another interrupted story. But maybe that's what I photograph—how people rebuild after their narratives break."

Later, while Sera met with her gallery contact—who'd asked to see her Michal project but then canceled last minute, citing "sensitive content concerns"—Ethan went to the construction site he passed each morning. Sera had been quiet about the rejection, but he'd seen her methodically reorganizing the photos afterward, searching for some other way forward. The foreman, Yossi, looked at his soft hands, his American clothes, his immigrant desperation.

"You ever build anything?"

"No."

"You strong?"

"I can become strong."

"You speak Hebrew?"

"Learning."

Yossi laughed, not unkindly. "Americans. You all come to find yourselves. You know what you find?" He gestured at the site. "Stones are heavy. Sun is hot. Building hurts." He pulled out his phone, showed Ethan a photo—little girl missing her front teeth, grinning at a Purim carnival. "My granddaughter. Eight years old next month. Lives in Haifa with my daughter who thinks I should retire, learn watercolors. 'Saba,' she tells me, 'your back is shot.' True. But concrete doesn't complain like watercolors do."

"I need work."

"Tomorrow, five AM. Bring water. Bring work clothes. Bring humility. I pay cash first week while you sort documents. Work permit's tricky—Ministry's been cracking down. We'll see. If you last that long."

He lasted. Every morning, predawn darkness to the site, hands blistering then callousing, back screaming then strengthening, Hebrew improving through construction vocabulary—concrete, rebar, level, plumb, all the words for making things straight and true and permanent. The Palestinians on the crew taught him Arabic curses. The Russians taught him to drink Turkish coffee so strong it could dissolve mortar, and how to calculate angles without a calculator. 

On his third week, a man in expensive shoes appeared during lunch break, arguing with Yossi in rapid Hebrew. "Neighbor," Mahmoud, the Palestinian tile-setter, explained to Ethan in careful English. "His apartment\u2014shadow from our building will block his garden three hours each day. He threatens lawsuit." The man's voice rose, gesturing at Mahmoud and two other Palestinian workers. "And he doesn't like us working here. Says we're 'security risk.'" Mahmoud smiled grimly. "Forty years I work construction in Jerusalem. Built half the Jewish Quarter after '67. Now I'm security risk for laying tile."

Yossi's response was sharp, final. The expensive-shoes man left, still shouting. Work resumed, but something had shifted in the air—the weight of competing claims, of who belonged where, of whose labor built whose dreams on whose ancient ground.

"You see?" Yossi pointed at the skyline one morning, Jerusalem spread golden in sunrise. "Every building here is politics. Every stone is history. We build on top of what was, always. Layers and layers. Jewish, Arab, Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Ottoman, British, now us again." He kicked at a piece of rubble, uncovering a pottery shard. "Someone's breakfast bowl, maybe. Thousand years old."

His parents arrived two weeks later, their visit planned months ago when Ethan was supposed to be returning to Brooklyn, to sanity, to the life they'd built for him through careful assimilation, good schools, right choices. Instead they found their son dark from sun, rough from labor, speaking broken Hebrew to his pregnant girlfriend—not wife, they noted with concern—in a two-room apartment in East Talpiot where the mezuzah was actually touched, actually kissed, actually treated like more than decoration.

"This is what you chose?" His mother's voice cracked. She stood at the window, watching the construction site.

*God, she looks old. When did that happen? I'm breaking her heart.* "Mom, this is what—it chose me."

"Don't be—you're a college graduate. Six-figure salary. You had—"

"I have a future. Just not—" *Not the one you sacrificed for. Not the safe American dream you built for me.* "Not the one you planned."

His father scanned the apartment. "Healthcare?" *Always practical. Always worried.*

"It's free. Universal."

"Security? That stabbing in the Old City—"

"Dad, there was a shooting—in Brooklyn. Yesterday. Three dead." *Why am I being defensive? He's scared. They're both scared.*

They couldn't see it, what he saw. Couldn't feel what had shifted. They saw Israel through American eyes—dangerous, difficult, irrational, foreign. He saw it through eyes that had witnessed October 7th, traveled through exile, returned to find home where home had always been waiting, difficult and dangerous and irrational and his.

Sera made dinner, traditional Shabbat meal though it was Thursday, trying to show them something beyond politics, beyond practicality. His mother helped in the kitchen, pausing to admire the challah Sera had braided, then quietly humming a Hebrew lullaby she'd learned from his grandmother—the same woman whose diary she'd brought. "I haven't thought of that song in thirty years," she murmured, surprised by her own voice. His father noticed the mezuzah screws were loose and quietly tightened them, his lips moving in what looked like prayer, though he'd claim later he was just checking if the parchment was straight. Then he returned to the English Jerusalem Post, shaking his head at every article.

"The pregnancy," his mother said carefully. "When?"

"January. Maybe February."

"You'll come home for—for the birth? American citizenship—"

"No." *Too quick. Too harsh.* "The baby will be Israeli."

The silence that followed had weight, had history, had his grandparents' fleeing and his parents' assimilation and his own return all compressed into the space between words.

His mother reached into her purse, pulled out something wrapped in tissue paper. "I brought these." His grandmother's Shabbat candlesticks, the ones from Poland she'd mentioned in her voicemail months ago. "Your father found them in the attic. Along with her ketubah. And..." She hesitated. "Her diary. From 1948. When Israel..." She couldn't finish.

"When Israel became real," his father said quietly, running his fingers over the brass. "She wrote about dancing in the streets of Brooklyn. Crying and dancing. She wrote..." His voice caught. "She wrote that she wished her parents could see it. That the promise had been kept." He looked at his son, conflict raw in his eyes. "I never knew she dreamed of going there herself. Never knew she saved money for a trip that never happened."

"You can't be serious," his father said, changing the subject back, uncomfortable with the emotion.

"I've never been more serious."

"Israeli citizenship means military service. You want your child to—"

"To defend their home? Yes."

"This isn't your home, Ethan. You're American."

"I'm Israeli. Or will be. The paperwork is processing."

His mother crying now, quiet tears that she tried to hide. "We gave you everything. Good schools. Opportunities. Safety. And you choose... this?"

Ethan looked at Sera, who understood without translation, who'd heard this conversation in a dozen variations from a dozen immigrant families, the parents who couldn't understand why their children chose this.

"You gave me everything except—" Ethan stopped, started again. "Everything except a reason. To be Jewish. Beyond just—avoiding antisemitism. Here I don't need to—" *Am I making sense? Do I sound crazy?* "Here, my child will know who they are. Without translation."

"Your child will grow up in a war zone," his father said.

"My child will grow up—" *Home. But what if he's right? What if I'm endangering everything for some fantasy of belonging?* "Home. My child will grow up home."

They left three days later, earlier than planned, the visit cut short by irreconcilable difference, by the chasm between those who saw Israel as last resort and those who saw it as first choice. At the airport, his mother hugged him long, whispered, "When you come to your senses—and you will—we're here. Your room is still—" She stopped. "We're here."

But she was already speaking to someone who didn't exist, the Ethan who might wake up from this dream, might choose ease over meaning, might return to Brooklyn's safety and spiritual emptiness. That Ethan had died somewhere between Be'eri and Berlin, between the Nova festival grounds and the pyramid at Giza. This Ethan, the one building himself along with Jerusalem, was someone she didn't recognize.

The Ministry of Interior, a week later. Five hours of waiting—wrong forms, right forms, missing documents, found documents—the bureaucracy of belonging grinding slow as tectonic plates. The clerk, a Russian immigrant twenty years ago, looked at his papers with the exhaustion of someone who'd processed ten thousand dreams and watched nine thousand fade.

"Parents Jewish?"

"Yes."

"Grandparents?"

"My grandmother was. Holocaust survivor."

"Documents?"

He had them. Death certificate from Long Island. Birth certificate showing maiden name: Rosen. Her parents' names: Abraham and Sarah. The names that had been changed, hidden, Americanized, now excavated for the purpose of return.

"Marriage plans?" She looked at Sera's belly.

"Ken. Yes. We—soon."

"Your Hebrew?"

"Getting better? I hope?"

She almost smiled. "They all say that. Your kids will laugh at your accent." She pushed forms across the desk. "Sign. Hebrew date, not English."

He signed Ethan Israel Stone in Hebrew letters, the script still awkward in his hand but becoming familiar, like wearing his grandfather's clothes that slowly adjusted to his different body.

The clerk looked at his grandmother's death certificate, compared it to her birth certificate, frowned at something. "There's a discrepancy. Her father's name listed as 'Abraham' here, 'Avraham' there. Same person, but computer doesn't know that." She sighed. "Take this form to Genealogy Department, third floor. Get affidavit. Then come back. Maybe next week."

Ethan's chest tightened. "Next week?"

"Bureaucracy," she said, not unkindly. "Nothing moves fast here. Good thing is you're already in the system. Temporary permit still valid. You can work. Just not... official yet."

Construct. The word that had become everything. Raising apartments over ancient ground. Weaving language in rewired brain. Growing family in Sera's womb. Shaping self from demolished certainties.

That evening, Shabbat arriving with Jerusalem's particular Friday magic, the city shutting down and lighting up simultaneously, secular and religious joined in the rhythm of rest whether they admitted it or not. Ethan's hands, rough from the week's labor, lit candles with Sera. The Hebrew blessings came easier now, not from understanding but from repetition, from the body learning what the mind still translated.

"Baruch atah Adonai..." Blessed are you, Lord...

Through the window, construction cranes paused against the skyline, monuments to the endless building, the eternal argument against impermanence that was Jerusalem's deepest nature. Somewhere his parents were flying over the Atlantic, returning to safety, to certainty, to the exile they called home. Somewhere his grandmother's spirit was laughing or crying or both.

"Your hands," Sera said, taking them after the blessing. "They're different."

They were. Calloused, scarred, strong. Builder's hands. Israeli hands. Split knuckles from carrying rebar. Concrete burns on the palms.

"Everything's different," he said in Hebrew, the words coming without translation now, without thought, the language thinking for him as Sera had promised.

"Nachon," she agreed. Correct. "Everything different. Everything beginning."

She guided his rough hands to her belly where something built itself without blueprint, without struggle, with the same certainty that had brought him here, kept him here, transformed him here.

"Names," she said. "If it's a boy?"

*A boy. Will he look like me? Will he sound Israeli? Will my parents ever meet him?* "Something with building. Boneh? Binyamin?"

"From everything," she said. "You came from grandmothers. From October 7th. From Cairo and Berlin and—" She yawned. "All of it led here."

*All of it. Including the fear. Including the doubt. Including the possibility this is all a mistake.*

The muezzin's call to prayer echoed from East Jerusalem, church bells rang from the Christian Quarter, and in their apartment, Jewish life continued its ancient insistence on continuing. Ethan thought of his parents, probably somewhere over Greenland now, discussing their son with the calloused hands and the pregnant girlfriend, their son who'd traded Brooklyn's certainty for Jerusalem's ancient complications.

They couldn't see what he saw through the window: construction cranes against three-thousand-year-old walls, Mediterranean light on Judean stone, the place where his grandmother had dreamed of dancing but never came.

"I need to call Rabbi Levi," Ethan said. "About the wedding. About making this official."

"Tomorrow," Sera said. "After Shabbat. Tonight we just be. Tonight we just build through being."

Outside, Jerusalem settled into its Sabbath quiet, the construction sites dormant, the cranes like sleeping giants against the skyline. But inside, in Sera's womb, in Ethan's transforming consciousness, in the space between them that was becoming family, the construction continued.

His phone, set to silent for Shabbat, showed a text from his mother he wouldn't read until tomorrow: "Your father thinks I should let you go. I can't. You're my son. Even this version I don't recognize. When you're ready, we're here."

But he wasn't that son anymore. He was Ethan Israel Stone, building himself in Jerusalem stone by stone, word by word, day by day. His children would be born Israeli. His Hebrew would always carry an accent. His hands would stay rough from building. His parents would never understand.

And that was okay.

The crane's brake squealed at dawn. Concrete dust settled in his prayer book. The weight of stones in his hands each morning.

"Shabbat shalom," Sera said, the words complete, perfect, needing no translation.

"Shabbat shalom," he replied, his Hebrew accent making her smile, his builder's hands holding her carefully, his American past and Israeli future reconciling in this moment of rest between buildings, between languages, between the person he'd been and the person he was becoming, stone by stone, word by word, choice by choice in Jerusalem where everyone was building something from the ruins of something else.

Tomorrow he would return to construction.

Tomorrow he would continue learning Hebrew.

Tomorrow he would plan a wedding, prepare for fatherhood, navigate bureaucracy.

But tonight was Shabbat in Jerusalem.

Outside, the construction cranes stood motionless against the sky, waiting for Sunday. The crane's brake cables gleamed in the fading light. Concrete dust had settled into the grain of his prayer book, gray powder marking each page he'd turned during evening prayers.

He closed the book, felt the roughness of mortar still embedded under his fingernails. 

The worry remained, quiet and persistent as Jerusalem stone.
