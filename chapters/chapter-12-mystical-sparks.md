# Chapter 12: Mystical Sparks

The Zohar fell open to a page about hidden light, and Ethan felt his grandmother's presence in the room.

Rabbi Levi's study—walls of Hebrew texts, leather bindings cracking with age, menorah shadows dancing. But tonight the October darkness pressing against the windows held electricity.

"You asked why you feel broken." Rabbi Levi squinted at the text, his finger following right to left. "Shevirat HaKelim. The Breaking of the Vessels."

Ethan shifted. His product manager mind wanted a problem statement, not mysticism. "Rabbi, I need practical—"

"You design products, yes? First you create space. Remove features. Simplify the interface."

"Yes, but that's UX design, not—"

"Tzimtzum." The rabbi's arthritic fingers struggled with the heavy Zohar, pages stuck together with centuries. "Divine contraction. Like your minimum viable product. God had to minimize to make room for creation."

Ethan helped separate the pages, feeling the paper's texture—rough, almost alive. A margin note in faded brown ink caught his eye: "The breaking is the beginning."

"Like depression is withdrawal?"

"Or making space for something new."

The rabbi drew a simple diagram—vessels, light, breaking. His hand trembled—age or intensity, Ethan couldn't tell. "The vessels meant to contain divine light—they shattered."

"They weren't strong enough?"

"They were exactly as strong as needed." Coffee stains marked the paper from previous lessons. Real stains, real paper, not the pristine PDFs Ethan was used to. "Breaking wasn't failure. It was the beginning of repair."

Ethan tried reading the Hebrew beneath the diagram. Mem looked like Nun. Bet looked like Kaf. The letters swam. "I can't even read this properly."

"Good. Knowing you don't know is the beginning."

"But I feel empty. Like I'm performing life without—"

"Every dating app swipe, every late-night scroll—you're debugging your loneliness." Rabbi Levi's knowing look made Ethan squirm. "But using the wrong error logs."

The rabbi stood with effort, knees cracking, and pulled down a book that shed leather flakes. "Your grandmother knew this. Rivka Stone. She brought you here once."

"When?"

"You were seven."

Memory flickered—dark wood, her hand wrapped around his, powder and rosewater scent, the way she squeezed his fingers three times when nervous. Her Yiddish whisper: "Shayna punim, this is important." The scratch of her wool coat against his cheek. "I don't remember."

"She understood broken vessels. Every survivor does." The rabbi opened to a page. The binding cracked. "Try reading this."

Ethan struggled with the Hebrew. "Or... Or Ha..."

"Or HaGanuz. Hidden Light." Rabbi Levi corrected his pronunciation. "Again."

"Or HaGanuz."

"Better. The primordial light, hidden in the Torah, in souls, in moments of truth. In you, Ethan Israel."

"In me?" Ethan laughed, bitter. "I eat bacon. I haven't been to synagogue since—"

"Seven-eighteen."

Ethan froze. "What?"

"Your name's gematria. Ethan Israel Stone. Calculate it."

"That's just... that's numerology. Astrology for math nerds."

"And yet."

"Maybe." The rabbi started drawing something complex, then stopped, rubbed his eyes. "Another time. The details can wait. What matters is this: your depression—it's judgment without mercy. The vessels breaking inside you."

"This sounds like metaphor. Like you're retrofitting ancient texts to modern psychology."

"Is it?"

"Come on, Rabbi. Broken vessels? Divine sparks? It's poetic, but—"

"But what? Not empirical? Not A/B tested?" The rabbi's eyes sharpened. "You wake at 7:18 every day. Your coffee costs $7.18. Your grandmother's yahrzeit—October 7, 1+8. Tell me that's coincidence."

"That's exactly what it is. Pattern recognition. The human brain finding meaning where—"

"Where there is none? Or where you're afraid to see it?"

Ethan's throat tightened. "I'm not afraid. I'm rational."

"How's that working for you? The rationality?"

Silence.

"How else could the Infinite speak to a Brooklyn product manager?"

Despite himself, Ethan felt his resistance cracking. "My grandmother knew all this?"

"She knew about gathering sparks in darkness. Especially there."

Rabbi Levi wrote out Hebrew letters, slowly, painfully. His handwriting was barely legible. "Study this before sleep. Friday—light Shabbat candles."

"I don't know the prayers."

"So learn. Or don't. The light doesn't care about perfect pronunciation."

Walking home, Ethan felt different. Not fixed. Just... oriented. Like finally understanding the backend architecture of something he'd only seen through the UI.

In his apartment, behind old cables and dust: his grandmother's candlesticks. Tarnished green-black at the joints. One was dented. Real damage on real brass.

He set them next to his coffee maker. Sacred beside mundane.

That night, studying Rabbi Levi's barely legible Hebrew, he had to guess half the letters. The passage was about gathering sparks. Or maybe about lifting fallen things. His Hebrew wasn't good enough to be sure.

He tried to light a practice candle. The match broke. The second match burned his fingers. The third lit but the candle wouldn't catch—the wick was buried in wax.

He dug it out with a kitchen knife, getting wax under his fingernails. Finally, a flame. It guttered, almost died, then steadied.

At 2 AM, instead of scrolling through metrics dashboards, he stood at his window. Each city light a data point. Each one isolated, waiting for connection.

He texted Rabbi Levi: "I think I'm beginning to understand."

No response. The rabbi was probably asleep, or couldn't find his phone, or had forgotten to charge it. Human limitations. Real world.

Friday was two days away. He googled "Shabbat candle blessing." Fifteen different versions came up. Which was right? Did it matter?

His grandmother's voice in memory: "To remember. To not forget."

But what exactly was he supposed to remember? The prayers? The traditions? Her?

The candlesticks sat on his counter, waiting. One still had old wax in it—his grandmother's? Someone else's? How many Friday nights had they held light?

He scraped out the old wax, his fingernail blackening. Physical debugging. Hardware not software. Creating space in the system for new processes to run.

The sparks were everywhere, maybe. And maybe he was ready to start gathering them.

Or maybe he'd just light candles badly and feel foolish.

Either way, Friday was coming.
