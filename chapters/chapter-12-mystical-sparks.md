# Chapter 12: Mystical Sparks

The Zohar fell open to a page about hidden light, and Ethan felt his grandmother's presence in the room.

Rabbi Levi's study—walls of Hebrew texts, leather bindings cracking with age, menorah shadows dancing. Tonight the October darkness pressing against the windows held electricity.

"You asked why you feel broken." Rabbi Levi squinted at the text, his finger following right to left. "Shevirat HaKelim. The Breaking of the Vessels."

Ethan shifted. His product manager mind wanted a problem statement, not mysticism. "Rabbi, I need something practical—"

"You design products, yes? First you create space. Remove features. Simplify the interface."

"Yes, but what does that have to do with—"

"Tzimtzum." The rabbi's arthritic fingers struggled with the heavy Zohar. "Divine contraction. Like your minimum viable product. God had to minimize to make room for creation."

Ethan helped separate the stuck pages, feeling their texture—rough, almost alive. A margin note in faded brown ink caught his eye: "The breaking is the beginning."

"So depression is... withdrawal?"

"Or making space for something new."

The rabbi drew a simple diagram—vessels, light, breaking. His hand trembled with age. "The vessels meant to contain divine light—they shattered."

"They weren't strong enough?"

"They were exactly as strong as needed. Breaking wasn't failure—"

"Come on." Ethan leaned back in his chair. "Shattered vessels? That's just metaphor for trauma, right? Ancient psychology?"

"Is it?" The rabbi's eyes sharpened. "Your grandmother understood broken vessels. Every survivor does."

Coffee stains marked the paper from previous lessons. Real stains, real paper, not the pristine PDFs Ethan was used to. "I still don't see how this helps me feel less empty."

"Every dating app swipe, every late-night scroll—you're debugging your loneliness. But using the wrong error logs."

The rabbi stood with effort, knees cracking, and pulled down a book that shed leather flakes. "Rivka brought you here once."

"When?" But memory flickered—dark wood, her hand wrapped around his, powder and rosewater scent. Her Yiddish whisper: "Shayna punim, this is important."

"You were seven. She understood gathering sparks in darkness."

The rabbi opened to a marked page, binding cracking. "Try reading this."

Ethan struggled with the Hebrew. "Or... Or Ha..."

"Or HaGanuz. Hidden Light. The primordial light, hidden in souls, in moments of truth. In you, Ethan Israel."

"In me?" Ethan laughed, bitter. "I eat bacon. I work on Saturdays. I haven't been to synagogue since my bar mitzvah."

"And yet you're here."

"Because I'm desperate. Not because I'm... divinely sparked or whatever."

"What's the difference?" Rabbi Levi studied his face. "Your depression—it's judgment without mercy. The vessels breaking inside you. But breaking is the beginning of repair."

Despite himself, Ethan felt his resistance wavering. "So what do I do with this? Light candles and wait for mystical revelation?"

"Start with candles. See what happens."

Rabbi Levi wrote out Hebrew letters, slowly, painfully. His handwriting was barely legible. "Study this before sleep. Friday—light Shabbat candles."

"I don't know the prayers."

"So learn. Or don't. The light doesn't care about perfect pronunciation."

Walking home, Ethan felt different. Not fixed. Just... oriented. Like finally understanding the backend architecture of something he'd only seen through the UI.

In his apartment, behind old cables and dust: his grandmother's candlesticks. Tarnished green-black at the joints. One was dented—real damage on real brass.

He set them next to his coffee maker. Sacred beside mundane.

That night, studying Rabbi Levi's barely legible Hebrew, he had to guess half the letters. The passage was about gathering sparks. Or maybe lifting fallen things. His Hebrew wasn't good enough to be sure.

He tried to light a practice candle. The match broke. The second match burned his fingers. The third lit but wouldn't catch—the wick was buried in wax from years of neglect.

He dug it out with a kitchen knife, getting waxy residue under his fingernails. Finally, a flame. It guttered, almost died—then steadied.

For a moment, watching that small light hold against the darkness, he thought about his grandmother. Not her death but her life. Friday nights when he was small, the way she'd cover her eyes and whisper prayers that made their cramped apartment expand into something infinite. Had she felt this uncertainty, this mixture of hope and foolishness?

The flame flickered but held.

He texted Rabbi Levi: "I think I'm beginning to understand."

No response. The rabbi was probably asleep, or couldn't find his phone. Human limitations. Real world.

Friday was two days away. The candlesticks sat on his counter, waiting. One still had old wax in it—his grandmother's wax, maybe. How many Friday nights had they held light?

He scraped out the residue, his fingernail blackening. Physical debugging. Creating space in the system for new processes to run.

The sparks were everywhere, maybe. And maybe he was ready to start gathering them. Or maybe he'd just light candles badly and feel foolish.

The flame guttered one more time, then steadied. Waiting.
