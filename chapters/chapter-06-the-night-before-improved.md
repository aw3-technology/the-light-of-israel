# Chapter 6: The Night Before

The candlesticks on his counter glowed in the darkness, though he hadn't lit them.

Friday night, October 6th. Brass catching streetlight through windows he'd forgotten to close. His grandmother's yahrzeit candles unlit on a counter that felt like an altar to unnamed failures.

Netflix asked if he was still watching. Three episodes had passed—serial killers or startup founders, the plots blurring into stories about people destroying everything except what needed destroying: the emptiness that made destruction feel like creation.

7:18 PM on his phone. Always that number when he looked. Three missed calls from his mother. Eighteen unread Slack messages. One text from Aaron: "Still on for coffee tomorrow?"

Tomorrow. Saturday. October 7th. Something about the date scratched inside his skull like a memory trying to form.

He ordered Thai food. Same place, same order. But tonight it sat untouched—the smell wrong, too sweet, synthetic. His stomach turned with that feeling before flights, before first dates, before news that changes everything. Except he had no flights, no dates, no news coming.

Just a persistent itch behind his left eye. A metallic taste that wouldn't leave. His hands trembling slightly as he scrolled.

His laptop showed seventeen open tabs:
- "Tensions escalate along Gaza border"
- "Weather Brooklyn tomorrow" 
- "Time in Israel"
- "What does Simchat Torah mean"
- "Grandmother yahrzeit when to light candle"

The Gaza headline from three hours ago. He'd read it twice, the words sliding past comprehension. Something about Hamas. Something about borders. His eye twitched again.

Through the wall, his neighbor's music—Arabic or Turkish, quarter-tones bending into shapes English couldn't make. At the window, he stopped. Below: two Hasidic men walking urgently, already late. Sabbath had begun. They'd missed it. Like him.

Work emails pulsed: "Need those KPIs by Monday."

His phone buzzed. Mom: "Just checking in. Dad and I are watching that British mystery show you recommended. Love you."

He hadn't recommended any show. Hadn't recommended anything in months. This was how they communicated now—invented connections, manufacturing memories to bridge unbridgeable distance.

"Love you too," he texted back. 9:47 PM.

The exhaustion hit suddenly. Not tiredness but something deeper—soul exhaustion, the kind sleep couldn't cure. He collapsed onto unmade sheets, still dressed. The candlesticks pulsed in his peripheral vision.

Sleep came wrong—too fast, too heavy, falling through rest into something older.

Flash: Hebrew school classroom, age seven, Cincinnati winter. Mrs. Goldman writing names on the board. "Ethan means strong. But your Hebrew name..."

The garden. Not planted but constructed from names. Each flower a forgotten ancestry growing backwards.

His name growing in the center. Not Ethan. The other one. The hidden one.

"Israel."

Flash: His grandmother, young, thirty-three, his age now. "Tomorrow everything changes."

The garden became wall. Warm limestone. Pulse beneath rock. Papers falling from cracks like snow. Like ash.

"I don't know the prayers," he said.

"You are the prayer."

Flash: Detention, age twelve, for laughing during the Mourner's Kaddish. The rabbi's disappointed face. "You'll understand someday. When it matters."

"Tomorrow the world breaks. Breaking is how the light gets in."

"What light?"

"Or HaGanuz. The hidden light."

The dream shattered. Each piece becoming its own dream, multiplying into incomprehension more true than understanding.

3:33 AM.

Sheets twisted into Hebrew letters he couldn't read but his body had been writing. The apartment darker than dark should be. His throat dry, constricted. That metallic taste stronger.

No notifications. The silence too complete, like the world holding its breath.

The candlesticks actually glowing—brass conducting energy that had nothing to do with electricity. Friday night becoming Saturday morning, Sabbath occurring whether observed or not.

Mirror: his face different. Not changed but revealed. Angles he'd forgotten. Inheritance he'd forgotten he'd inherited.

Back to bed. No more dreams that could be remembered. Just his grandmother at a table set for Sabbath. Waiting.

"Soon."

5:41 AM.

Sky preparing to break into color. Birds gathering song, waiting for an invisible conductor.

Phone: dead. Not drained but dead, silicon remembering it was earth. He plugged it in. The apple appeared, disappeared, appeared.

Shower. Coffee. Too early for Saturday, too late for Friday.

The candlesticks just brass again, inheritance tarnishing on a counter in a life that needed something he couldn't name.

His hands shook slightly as he held his coffee. That itch behind his left eye intensifying.

Phone finishing resurrection. The apple becoming screen becoming—

6:47 AM.

The birds stopped singing.
Brooklyn held its breath.
October 7th.

The buzzing started. Not one notification but dozens, hundreds. Breaking news that broke everything. The buzz becoming roar becoming the sound the world makes when it discovers distance is illusion, safety is temporary, inheritance includes not just candlesticks but catastrophe.

But for this moment—this last moment before knowledge—Ethan Stone sat on the edge of his bed, his grandmother's candlesticks waiting like witnesses. Like warnings. Like promises that even in the darkness coming, there was light.

Hidden light.
Ancient light.
Light that would have to be wrestled from darkness like a name from an angel.

Israel.
The wrestling was about to begin.

His phone buzzed again.
And again.
And again.
