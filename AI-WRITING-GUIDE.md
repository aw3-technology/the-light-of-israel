## CORE MISSION

Write a novel that:
- Honors the complexity of modern Jewish identity
- Treats all traditions with respect
- Makes philosophy live through story
- Transforms depression into journey
- Shows that return is always possible
- Demonstrates that light persists through darkness
- Proves that love and faith are intertwined
- Argues that personal and collective healing connect
- Insists that truth exists but isn't simple
- Celebrates the human capacity for transformation

The Light of Israel should read like a contemporary classic: accessible enough for wide readership, profound enough for multiple readings, specific enough to feel real, universal enough to resonate across cultures.

Every sentence should serve both story and meaning. Every character should be both person and possibility. Every chapter should be both entertaining and enlightening.

This is not just Ethan's story — it's a meditation on what it means to be human, to suffer, to seek, and to find not answers but presence.
