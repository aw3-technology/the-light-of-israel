## Themes
- Progressive echo chamber
- Performance of politics without spirit
- Intellectual community without soul
- Alienation among friends

## Important Details
- Friends don't know Eden's middle name
- All successful, all empty
- Politics as replacement religion
- No mention of Jewish identity

## Dialogue Highlights
- Aaron: "We need to dismantle systemic oppression"
- Sarah: "I'm so tired of living through historical events"
- Marcus: "Everything's content now, even resistance"
- Eden: "Yeah, totally" (automatic responses)

## Internal Monologue
- "We sound so smart and feel so nothing"
- "When did caring become performance?"
- "Aaron believes in something. What do I believe in?"
- "We're all drowning in our own awareness"

## Symbolism
- Craft cocktails = manufactured authenticity
- Exposed brick = false rusticity  
- Group chat = digital congregation
- Wednesday = middle of nowhere

## Foreshadowing
- News alert about Israel ignored
- Eden's grandmother mentioned briefly
- Feeling of something approaching
- "October's going to be rough" (someone says randomly)

## Chapter Arc
Work performance ’ social performance ’ political performance ’ recognition of emptiness

## Writing Notes
- Friends aren't villains, also searching
- Show genuine care beneath performance
- Progressive politics as spiritual substitute
- Eden's alienation is internal

## Ending
Uber home alone. Group chat continues without him. Lies in bed, scrolling Twitter, feeling the weight of performed caring. Thinks: "We're all so good at analyzing why everything's broken."

## Connection to Next Chapter
Leads to phone call with parents (Chapter 4) - different generation's emptiness

## Revision Considerations
- Avoid caricaturing progressive friends
- Show real friendship beneath ideology
- Balance critique with empathy
- Make Eden complicit, not superior
