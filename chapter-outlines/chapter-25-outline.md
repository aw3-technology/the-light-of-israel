## Ending
Tel Aviv bound. Eden carries: Polish earth, Roman recipe, Torah pointer, grandmother's candlesticks, his own transformation. At Cairo airport, security exhaustive. "Why were you here?" "To leave," Eden answers. "Every Jew must leave Egypt." Guard confused, lets him pass. Boarding Israeli plane, hears Hebrew announcements. Tears immediate. Texts Sera: "I'm coming home." Her response: "You ARE home. Wherever you are, you're home." Through window, pyramids shrink. After 40 days in exile, Eden Israel Stone chooses return.

- Show individual humanity
- Balance ancient and modern
- Make exodus personal not preachy
