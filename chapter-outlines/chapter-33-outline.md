## Final Image
Eden and Sera walking through Damascus Gate into the day. Arab vendors setting up, Jewish families passing, church bells ringing. Eden carrying all of it - the complexity, the light, the darkness, the hope. "Where now?" Sera asks. "Forward," Eden says. "Together," she says. They walk into the living city.

## Connection to Themes
- All themes integrated not resolved
- Journey continues
- Light carried not hoarded
- Wrestling eternal

## Revision Considerations
- Don't provide false closure
- Keep ending open yet complete
- Balance all elements
- Trust reader's intelligence
- End with life not philosophy

## Final Lines Options
1. "The light of Israel burns forward."
2. "Eden Israel Stone. Beginning, middle, no end."
3. "The wrestling continues. The light remains."
4. Simple: "He walked forward, carrying light."

## Note on Ending
The novel ends not with answers but with presence. Eden has become who he always was - the garden, the wrestling, the foundation. The light of Israel is not a solution but a responsibility, carried forward with love.
