Husband of Seraphina who showed me the way
Student of Rabbi Levi who opened the gates
Wrestler with God who finally won by losing
Carrier of light that was always there
Thank you for October 7th
Thank you for the breaking that led to wholeness
Thank you for the exile that led home
Thank you for the darkness that revealed the light
I am here. Hineni.
The light of Israel burns forward."

## Final Image
The family walking home through Jerusalem morning. Twins on Eden's shoulders, Sera's hand in his, her other hand on her belly (daughter coming). Parents walking behind, attempting Hebrew with vendors. Ahmad waves from coffee shop. Rabbi Levi passes, nods. The city fully alive—Arabs, Jews, Christians, all the complexity, all the conflict, all the holiness. 

Ari asks in perfect Hebrew: "Abba, what's the light of Israel?"
Eden thinks, then answers in Hebrew: "It's what we carry when we remember who we are."
"Are we the light?" Lev asks.
"We hold it," Eden says. "And pass it on."
"To who?"
"To everyone ready to see."

They continue walking. Jerusalem stones golden in morning sun. Traffic beginning. Sirens (regular, not war). Life continuing. Eden Israel Stone—beginning, middle, foundation—carrying forward. The light not found but recognized. Not achieved but accepted. Not ending but continuing.

The light of Israel burns forward.

## Connection to Themes
- All themes integrated not resolved
- Journey continues
- Light carried not hoarded
- Wrestling eternal

## Revision Considerations
- Don't provide false closure
- Keep ending open yet complete
- Balance all elements
- Trust reader's intelligence
- End with life not philosophy

## Final Lines Options
1. "The light of Israel burns forward."
2. "Eden Israel Stone. Beginning, middle, no end."
3. "The wrestling continues. The light remains."
4. Simple: "He walked forward, carrying light."

## Note on Ending
The novel ends not with answers but with presence. Eden has become who he always was - the garden, the wrestling, the foundation. The light of Israel is not a solution but a responsibility, carried forward with love.
