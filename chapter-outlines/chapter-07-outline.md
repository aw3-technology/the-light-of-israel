- Colleague: "Geopolitically complex situation"
- Eden (not sent): "Why do I feel like I'm dying?"

## Internal Monologue
- "This isn't about politics"
- "Something ancient is screaming"
- "I don't know these people but they're mine"
- "Eden Israel Stone - Israel - it's in my name"

## Symbolism
- October 7 = Simchat Torah (joy turned to mourning)
- Broken phone screen from dropping = shattered vessel
- Havdalah time = separation of sacred and profane
- Doom-scrolling = modern lamentation

## Divine Elements (Intensifying)
- Grandmother's yahrzeit is today (he finally remembers)
- Phone cracks in pattern resembling Hebrew letter
- Candles on counter seem to glow without being lit
- 613 unread messages (number of commandments)
- Birds silent all day (nature mourning)
- Automatic "Baruch Dayan HaEmet" typed (he doesn't know Hebrew)

## Foreshadowing
- Googling synagogues
- Feeling of being called
- Dream imagery returning
- Body knowing before mind
- Searching "how to pray in Hebrew"

## Chapter Arc
Normal Saturday → first news → escalating horror → ideological crisis → emotional break → spiritual opening

## Writing Notes
- Respect real tragedy, don't exploit
- Show physical response to trauma
- Progressive friends aren't villains, just limited
- Eden's response is beyond rational

## Technical Elements
- Use real-time formatting
- Short paragraphs during panic
- Longer sections for dissociation
- Fragment sentences during shock

## Ending
Eden at window, looking at Brooklyn at night. Lights in windows - wondering who else is feeling this. Opens laptop, searches "synagogue Upper West Side." Closes laptop. Opens again.

## Connection to Next Chapter
Leads directly to attending vigil (Chapter 8) - first step toward community

## Revision Considerations
- Handle real tragedy with care
- Don't make political statements
- Focus on Eden's internal experience
- Avoid exploiting real suffering
- Make spiritual awakening felt, not explained
