## Symbolism
- Four cities = four exiles

- Aramaic dream = deep ancestry calling
- Travel mezuzah = portable sanctuary
- Dead Sea stone = lowest point carried

- Rabbi has exact contacts needed
- Money appears (freelance project pays)
- Weather window for travel opens

## Mystical Framework
- **Tikkun through travel**: Gathering sparks worldwide
- **Personal exodus**: Individual must experience collective
- **Exile as preparation**: Can't know home without leaving
- **Four kingdoms**: Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome (mystical architecture)

## Relationship Note
- Sera secure enough to release him
- Understanding this is solo journey
- Their bond transcends presence
- "I'm not going anywhere" she says
- Physical intimacy after spiritual certainty

## Chapter Arc
Dream → Interpretation → Planning → Resistance → Acceptance → Preparation → Departure ready

## Writing Notes
- Make calling feel inevitable not forced
- Show Sera's strength in letting go
- Rabbi as guide not commander
- Eden's agency in choosing
- Balance practical with mystical

## Ending
Ben Gurion Airport, dawn. Sera drives him. At security, she hands him something wrapped—his grandmother's candlesticks, travel-sized. "Light them wherever you are Friday night. Remember who you are." Eden Israel Stone, carrying Jerusalem in his heart, boards plane to Athens. Through window, watches Israel shrink but not disappear. His phone shows message from Rabbi: "Jeremiah 29:7—Seek the peace of the city where I have sent you into exile." The exile begins. Or perhaps it's ending.

## Connection to Next Chapter
Leads to Chapter 21 - Athens, confronting Hellenism

## Revision Considerations
- Don't make journey feel arbitrary
- Keep Sera's reaction complex
- Show practical challenges
- Avoid "finding yourself" cliché
- Ground mystical in emotional truth
