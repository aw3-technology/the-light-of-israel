Evening, apartment balcony, Jerusalem spread below. Aaron holding Ari while Eden holds Lev. Sera making dinner inside. Aaron: "I never understood what 'Next year in Jerusalem' meant." Eden: "Neither did I until I got here." Aaron: "I'm not ready to make aliyah." Eden: "You don't have to be. But maybe you're ready to stop running." Below, muezzin call to prayer mingles with Hebrew songs from radio. Two friends, Jews, holding Jewish babies, in Jewish city, no longer afraid of what that means.

## Character Development Achieved
Aaron Gold transformed from rigid progressive using politics to avoid identity into complex progressive embracing Jewish identity while maintaining justice commitments. Shows multiple paths to Jewish identity, the role of love as teacher, and friendship surviving ideological evolution.

## Aaron's Growth Arc
- Was: Rigid progressive using politics to avoid identity
- Journey: Palestinian girlfriend forces self-examination
- Now: Still progressive but embracing Jewish identity

## The Palestinian Girlfriend - Layla Al-Mansouri's Role
- Graduate student in comparative literature, focuses on exile narratives
- Third-generation Palestinian-American from Detroit
- Family from Bethlehem, emigrated in 1970s
- Met Aaron at Columbia protest, saw through his performative allyship
- Forces Aaron to examine: using Palestinian cause to avoid Jewish identity
- Her family's key challenge: "How can he love us if he won't love himself?"
- Her grandmother's village stories parallel Aaron's grandmother's Holocaust memories

## Revision Considerations
- Ensure Aaron's change feels earned
- Balance individual growth with relationship healing
- Don't resolve political differences too neatly
- Show ongoing complexity not neat conclusions
