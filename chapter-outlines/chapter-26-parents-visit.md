# Chapter 26 Addition: First Israel Visit

## Scene to Add: Parents' Phone Call After First Israel Visit
*This scene should be added to Chapter 26 (The Abyss) as an epilogue scene*

### The Call After Their Visit
- Eden in Berlin, processing Holocaust experience
- Phone call from parents back in New York
- They sound different - shaken but not by trauma

### What They Saw
- "We met Sera. She's... extraordinary"
- "We held our grandsons at the Western Wall"
- "You looked happy, Eden. Really happy."
- "We saw you light Shabbat candles like you knew what you were doing"

### Their Own Experience
- David: "I put my hand on the Wall and... something happened"
- Miriam: "I cried for reasons I don't understand"
- "The stones felt warm"
- "Everyone was praying but we didn't know how"

### The Admission
- "Maybe we were wrong to be afraid"
- "This isn't you rejecting us"
- "You found something we lost"
- "How do we... how do we learn?"

### Eden's Response
- Speaking from Berlin, site of Jewish destruction
- "It's never too late to come home"
- "Start with lighting Friday night candles"
- "Sera can teach you Hebrew blessings"

### The Commitment
- "We bought a Hebrew primer at the airport"
- "David found a synagogue that offers adult education"
- "We want to understand what our grandsons are saying"
- "Maybe it's time for our own journey"

## Dialogue
- David: "I'm 64 years old. Is it too late to become Jewish?"
- Eden: "Dad, you've always been Jewish. Now you're choosing to live it"
- Miriam: "Your grandmother would be proud"
- Eden: "She already is"

## Significance
- Parents transformed by witnessing Eden's happiness
- Their own spiritual awakening begins
- Generational healing through grandchildren
- Parents become students of their own tradition
- Sets up their continued growth in later chapters
