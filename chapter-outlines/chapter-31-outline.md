- Air thick with holiness
- Light different quality
- Sound of all prayers at once

## Ending
Walking home through Jerusalem, morning traffic beginning. Eden normal outside, transformed within. Passes Western Wall, touches briefly. Arrives home to twins crying, Sera exhausted. Takes boys, changes diapers, makes coffee. Ordinary after extraordinary. But carrying vision like pregnancy. Sera: "Where were you?" Eden: "At the beginning and end." She looks at him, sees something, says nothing. Day continues. Vision pulses beneath everything. Eden Israel Stone, holding future and past, changing diapers in present. The middle kingdom embodied.

## Connection to Next Chapter
