# Character-Specific Dialogue Guide

## Overview
Each character must have a completely distinctive voice that reveals their background, education, emotional state, and relationship to language itself. Dialogue should carry subtext, advance character development, and feel authentically rooted in each person's psychology and culture.

What are we evenâ€”never mind. The numbers are good."

"It's not that I don't believe in... I just don't know what I believe in anymore."

Something in Yiddish. Or Hebrew? They all sound the same to me."
```

### **Awakening Eden** (Chapters 11-20)
```

is still praying. Does that sound crazy?"

Do dreams know languages we don't?"
```

## Hebrew/Arabic Integration Guidelines

### **Natural Code-Switching Rules**

1. **Emotional Moments**: Characters revert to mother tongue
2. **Religious Contexts**: Hebrew/Arabic naturally emerge
3. **Cultural Concepts**: Some ideas only exist in original language
4. **Intimacy**: Partners/family use heritage language terms
5. **Anger/Stress**: Authentic emotional expression breaks through

### **Authentic Usage Examples**

#### **Hebrew** (with natural transliteration)
- **"Ima"** (Mother) - emotional, not formal "Mother"
- **"Shabbat shalom"** - greeting, not translation needed
- **"B'ezrat Hashem"** (With God's help) - when facing difficulty
- **"Baruch Hashem"** (Blessed is God) - gratitude expression
- **"Oy vey"** - frustration (Yiddish but understood)

#### **Arabic** (Palestinian characters)
- **"Yalla"** (Come on) - common loan word in Hebrew too
- **"Habibi"** (My dear) - term of endearment
- **"Inshallah"** (God willing) - future plans
- **"Wallahi"** (I swear to God) - emphasis
- **"Habibti"** (My dear - feminine) - to women/girls

### **Avoiding Tokenism**
- Only use words that serve character or story development
- Never translate immediately unless character needs explanation
- Let context provide meaning when possible
- Use consistently within each character's background

This dialogue guide ensures every character has an authentic, distinctive voice that reveals their psychology, background, and growth throughout the novel while maintaining cultural authenticity and emotional truth.
