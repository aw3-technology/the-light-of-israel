# Hebrew & Arabic Language Authenticity Guide

## Overview
Authentic integration of Hebrew and Arabic that serves character development and cultural accuracy without alienating non-speakers. Every foreign language usage must feel natural, not forced, and advance either plot or character understanding.

## HEBREW INTEGRATION

### **Transliteration Standards**
Using modern Israeli pronunciation, not Ashkenazi or Sephardic variants for consistency:
- **Correct**: Shabbat (not Shabbos)
- **Correct**: Chanukah (not Hanukkah) 
- **Correct**: Kiddush (not Kidesh)
- **Correct**: Tallit (not Tallis)

### **Character-Specific Hebrew Usage**

#### **EDEN'S HEBREW PROGRESSION**

**Early Eden** (Chapters 1-10): *Mispronounces, uncertain*
```
"Sha-bat? Shab-bat?" (struggling with pronunciation)
"I think it's... baruch... something?" (remembering fragments)
"My grandmother used to say... what was it... gut Shabbes?" (mixing Yiddish/Hebrew)
"Is it kah-dish or kad-ish?" (uncertain about Kaddish)
```

**Learning Eden** (Chapters 11-20): *Phonetic, improving*
```
"Shabbat shalom" (careful pronunciation, still foreign)
"Baruch atah Adonai" (reading from siddur, stumbling)
"Hineni - here I am, right?" (seeking confirmation)
"Eden Yisrael Stone - that's my Hebrew name" (first time speaking it)
```

**Confident Eden** (Chapters 21-33): *Natural, fluent*
```
"Baruch Hashem" (spontaneous gratitude)
"B'ezrat Hashem, we'll find our way" (naturally expressing hope)
"Ribbono shel Olam, Master of the Universe" (prayer flows naturally)
"Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echad" (Shema with full understanding)
```

#### **SERA'S HEBREW** (Native Israeli)
```
Natural code-switching: "Listen, motek, it's not so complicated"

Emotional moments: "Elohim, give me strength" (God, give me strength)
Teaching Eden: "Say it with me: 'Modeh ani lifanecha'" (morning prayer)
```

#### **RABBI LEVI'S HEBREW** (Pedagogical, meaningful)
```
Teaching through Hebrew: "Teshuvah doesn't mean repentance. It means return."

Blessing students: "May the Shechinah rest upon you"
Casual integration: "Nu, so what did you learn today?"

## NATURAL CODE-SWITCHING RULES

### **When Characters Switch Languages**

#### **Emotional Peaks**
- Fear: Revert to mother tongue
- Anger: Curse in native language
- Prayer: Use traditional language
- Love: Intimate terms in heritage language
- Pain: Cry out in childhood language

#### **Cultural Contexts**
- Religious services: Hebrew/Arabic naturally emerge
- Family conversations: Heritage languages dominate
- Teaching moments: Explaining concepts in original language
- Memory triggers: Past events bring back associated language

#### **Social Dynamics**
- Including someone: Switch to common language
- Excluding someone: Use language they don't understand
- Showing respect: Use formal register in appropriate language
- Creating intimacy: Share untranslatable concepts

### **Translation Techniques**

#### **Context Clues** (No immediate translation needed)
```
"Shabbat shalom," Sera said, lighting the candles.
[Context makes meaning clear]

Eden whispered "Hineni" and placed his hand on the Wall.
[Spiritual context suggests response/presence]
```

#### **Character Translation** (Natural teaching moments)
```
"Teshuvah," Rabbi Levi said. "Not repentance - return. The Hebrew teaches us the difference."

"She called me habibi," Eden told Aaron. "It means 'my dear' in Arabic."
```

#### **Emotional Translation** (Feeling over literal meaning)
```
"Baruch Hashem," Eden whispered, tears in his eyes.
[Emotion conveys gratitude without translation needed]

Samira's "Inshallah" carried all her hope and fear for her students.
[Context shows prayer-like quality]
```

### **Avoiding Tokenism**

#### **Don't Do:**
- Drop foreign words randomly without purpose

- Use incorrect grammar in English to show accent
- Appropriate sacred language inappropriately

#### **Do:**
