## Resolution Requirements

By Chapter 33, all subplots must achieve:

1. **Aaron**: Reconciled identity as progressive Jew with Palestinian partner who understands complexity
2. **Parents**: Made aliyah or committed to deeper Jewish practice with grandchildren  
3. **Sera**: Healed from survivor's guilt, building family, representing Israeli resilience
4. **Rabbi Levi**: Successfully mentored next generation, ready for his own transition

Each subplot enriches rather than distracts from Eden's main journey while providing multiple perspectives on Jewish identity, trauma, healing, and return.
