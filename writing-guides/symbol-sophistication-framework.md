# Symbol Sophistication Framework
## Multi-Layered Meaning Architecture

## The Principle of Symbolic Depth
Each major symbol must operate on multiple levels simultaneously: personal/psychological, cultural/historical, spiritual/mystical, and universal/human. This creates resonance for diverse readers while maintaining authenticity to Jewish experience.
