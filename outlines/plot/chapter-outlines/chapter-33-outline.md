## Chapter Summary
Ethan returns to the Western Wall at dawn for final integration. The twins are three, speaking Hebrew as natives. His parents have made aliyah. He places a prayer note signed with his full name - Ethan Israel Stone - not seeking answers but offering presence. Sera joins him as the sun rises over Jerusalem. The light of Israel revealed as responsibility, not revelation.

## Final Image
The family walking home through Jerusalem morning. Twins on Ethan's shoulders, Sera's hand in his, her other hand on her belly (daughter coming). Parents walking behind, attempting Hebrew with vendors. Ahmad waves from coffee shop. Rabbi Levi passes, nods. The city fully alive—Arabs, Jews, Christians, all the complexity, all the conflict, all the holiness. 

Ari asks in perfect Hebrew: "Abba, what's the light of Israel?"
Ethan thinks, then answers in Hebrew: "It's what we carry when we remember who we are."
"Are we the light?" Lev asks.
"We hold it," Ethan says. "And pass it on."
"To who?"
"To everyone ready to see."

They continue walking. Jerusalem stones golden in morning sun. Traffic beginning. Sirens (regular, not war). Life continuing. Ethan Israel Stone—beginning, middle, foundation—carrying forward. The light not found but recognized. Not achieved but accepted. Not ending but continuing.

The light of Israel burns forward.

## Connection to Themes

- Wrestling eternal

## Revision Considerations
- Don't provide false closure
- Keep ending open yet complete
- Balance all elements
- Trust reader's intelligence
- End with life not philosophy

## Final Lines Options
1. "The light of Israel burns forward."
2. "Ethan Israel Stone. Beginning, middle, no end."
3. "The wrestling continues. The light remains."
4. Simple: "He walked forward, carrying light."

## Note on Ending
The novel ends not with answers but with presence. Ethan has become who he always was - the garden, the wrestling, the foundation. The light of Israel is not a solution but a responsibility, carried forward with love.
