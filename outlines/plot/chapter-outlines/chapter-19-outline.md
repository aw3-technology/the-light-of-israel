Jerusalem apartment, preparing for Shabbat together. Salt still in their hair despite showers. Ethan lights candles for second time in life, Sera guides his hands. "You smell like the Dead Sea," she laughs. "You smell like life," he responds, surprising himself with certainty. They drink wine, break bread. Outside, the call to prayer mingles with Shabbat sirens. Ethan thinks: "The lowest point on earth taught me to rise." His phone is off. His soul is on.
