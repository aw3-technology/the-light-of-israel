## Writing Notes
- Rabbi warm but not saccharine
- Mystical but grounded
- Eden's defenses crumbling
- Show don't tell the connection

## Ending
Eden leaves with the psalm, walks through Upper West Side night. Opens paper on subway, sees Hebrew and English. Reads: "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept." Tears come unexpectedly.

## Connection to Next Chapter
Leads to Eden processing childhood memories (Chapter 11)

## Revision Considerations
- Rabbi shouldn't have all answers
- Keep mysticism accessible
- Avoid magical negro trope
- Make relationship feel earned
