## Symbolism
- Candlesticks = unlit potential

## Foreshadowing

- Ancient patterns repeating
- Personal and collective merge
- The hidden about to be revealed
- Joy (Simchat Torah) becoming grief

## Chapter Arc
Evening anxiety → Failed distraction → Dream sequence → Prophetic visions → Dawn threshold

## Writing Notes
- Dreams should feel real, not surreal
- Don't explain symbolism
- Build tension through ordinary details
- The supernatural through natural
- Let reader feel the weight building

## Ending
6:47 AM. Eden's phone finishes charging, powers on. In seconds, it will flood with notifications that will change everything. But for this moment, in the gray dawn light, Eden Stone sits on the edge of his bed, his grandmother's candlesticks glowing with reflected sunrise, and feels, for reasons he cannot name, that he is standing at the edge of history. The birds have stopped singing. The world holds its breath. His phone begins to buzz.

## Revision Considerations
- Don't oversell the mystical
- Keep dreams grounded in emotion
- Balance prophecy with psychology
- Make supernatural feel natural
- Trust the reader's intuition
