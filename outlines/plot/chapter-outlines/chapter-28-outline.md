## Ending
One month later. Eden on balcony, 3 AM, twin boys sleeping on his chest. Jerusalem spread below, quiet for once. He whispers the Shema into their ears—the same prayer his grandmother whispered to him, that her grandmother whispered to her. The chain, broken and reforged. Tomorrow, rockets might fall. Tonight, his sons breathe against his chest, Israeli from first breath, Jewish from first cut, his from first cry. Eden Israel Stone, father in Jerusalem. The middle kingdom found: between past and future, exile and return, fear and love. His sons will never wonder who they are.
