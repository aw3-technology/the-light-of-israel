- Connect ancient to present

## Ending
Last morning, Ethan returns to Arch of Titus with Israeli flag pin (bought from tourists). Pins it inside his jacket, over his heart. Walks around the arch, never through. Takes photo to send Sera: him standing beyond arch, looking back. Caption: "We won." Boards train to Berlin, carrying Rome's weight but not its chains. Michele's parting gift: recipe for carciofi alla giudia. "Feed your children this. Tell them we never left."

## Revision Considerations
- Handle Jewish-Christian relations carefully
- Don't romanticize survival
- Show complexity of modern Rome
- Avoid victim narrative only
- Balance history with present life
