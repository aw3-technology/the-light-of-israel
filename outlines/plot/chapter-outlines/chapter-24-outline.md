## Writing Notes
- Extreme care needed
- Don't describe horror graphically
- Focus on absence not presence
- Make Stanisław real not symbolic
- Avoid redemptive narrative

## Ending

"It's my family," Eden says in Polish he didn't know he knew. They let him pass. Boards plane to Cairo. Through window, watches Poland disappear. Texts Sera: "I found them. I found the absence of them." She responds with just a heart. He understands. Some things have no words.

## Revision Considerations

- Avoid Holocaust tourism
- Don't appropriate suffering
- Focus on Eden's specific journey
- Let silence speak
