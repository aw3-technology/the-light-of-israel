## Writing Notes

- Show Eden's complete transformation

## The At-One-Ment
- With himself (all names integrated)
- With Sera and sons (family whole)
- With Jewish people (belonging)
- With Israel (home)
- With God (YHWH recognized)

## Ending
Stars appearing, fast broken, Eden on balcony with sons sleeping on his chest. Sera beside him, both depleted and full. Jerusalem beginning to hum again—cars starting, life resuming. But Eden remains in the pause, the moment between breath. He whispers to his sons: "You are Ari Yosef and Lev Mordechai Stone. You are Israeli. You are Jewish. You are mine. You are free." Below, someone starts their car. Above, stars that Abraham counted. Eden Israel Stone, thirty-four years old, finally, fully, simply, one.
