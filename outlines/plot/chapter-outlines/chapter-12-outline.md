## Ending
That night, Eden lights his grandmother's candles for the first time. He stumbles through the blessing, reading from his phone. The flames flicker and he remembers her words: "To remember. To not forget." But now he understands—it's not just memory. It's gathering light. His apartment, always so empty, feels suddenly inhabited. Not by ghosts but by possibility. He texts Rabbi Levi: "I lit them." The response: "Now you're gathering sparks." Eden stares at the flames until they blur through tears he doesn't try to stop. For the first time in years, they're not tears of depression but of recognition. The light was always there. Hidden, but there.
