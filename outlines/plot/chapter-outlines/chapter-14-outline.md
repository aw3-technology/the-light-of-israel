## Ending
That first night in Tel Aviv, Ethan can't sleep. Jet lag, but more. He stands on his balcony watching the Mediterranean darken, lights of Jaffa twinkling ancient across the water. His phone buzzes with worried texts from his mother, angry ones from Aaron. He doesn't answer. Instead, he practices Hebrew letters in a notebook, remembering his grandmother's handwriting. "Aleph, bet, gimel..." The letters of creation, Rabbi Levi called them. Below, Tel Aviv thrums with Thursday night energy, a city that parties through grief, that builds skyscrapers on prophets' paths. Tomorrow, someone said, he should visit Jaffa, see where Jonah fled from God. But tonight, for the first time in his life, Ethan Israel Stone isn't fleeing anything.
