- Eden: "First time anywhere that matters"
- Sera: "You look lost" / Eden: "I am"

## Internal Monologue
- "She's nothing like Rachel or the others"
- "How does she make belonging look so easy?"
- "This city is too much - history crushing down"
- "Why does she feel familiar?"

## Symbolism
- Jerusalem stone = foundation
- Shabbat candles = Sera's light
- Challah = sustenance offered
- Three religions visible = complexity

## Foreshadowing

- Sera's knowing look

## Chapter Arc
Arrival → overwhelm → Shabbat preparation → meeting Sera → recognition → possibility

## Writing Notes
- Jerusalem as overwhelming character
- Sera confident but not perfect
- Shabbat as natural, not forced
- Chemistry through spiritual recognition

## Sensory Details
- Golden late afternoon light
- Smell of challah, wine, spices
- Sound of multiple languages
- Stone texture everywhere
- Taste of sweet wine

## Ending
Walking back through Old City at night. Sera: "I'll show you the real Jerusalem tomorrow, if you want." Eden: "Yes." They part at corner. He watches her disappear into ancient streets, feeling something shift inside.

## Connection to Next Chapter
Next day, she'll take him to Western Wall (Chapter 16)

## Revision Considerations
- Make Sera real woman, not just symbol
- Jerusalem overwhelming but not cliché
- Balance romance with spiritual journey
- Keep their connection earned
