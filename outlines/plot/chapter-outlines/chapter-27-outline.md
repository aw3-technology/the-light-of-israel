## Ending
Sabbath eve, Sera and Ethan's apartment. Parents gone, place quiet. Ethan's hands, rough from construction, light candles steadily. Sera, showing now, says the blessing. Ethan adds, in broken Hebrew: "Thank you for this hard good life." Through window, cranes building Jerusalem. Inside, twins growing. Ethan thinks: "I am Israel, wrestling. My sons won't have to." Sera corrects his grammar gently. They laugh. Outside, the muezzin calls. Inside, Jewish life continues.
