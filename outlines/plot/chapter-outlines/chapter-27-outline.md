## Ending
Sabbath eve, Sera and Eden's apartment. Parents gone, place quiet. Eden's hands, rough from construction, light candles steadily. Sera, showing now, says the blessing. Eden adds, in broken Hebrew: "Thank you for this hard good life." Through window, cranes building Jerusalem. Inside, twins growing. Eden thinks: "I am Israel, wrestling. My sons won't have to." Sera corrects his grammar gently. They laugh. Outside, the muezzin calls. Inside, Jewish life continues.
