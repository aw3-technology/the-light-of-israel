## Character Development Notes

- Each archetypal character should be fully human, not just representing their worldview
- They should surprise Eden (and readers) with unexpected depths
- Their encounters should leave Eden changed, carrying pieces of each
- By the end, Eden integrates aspects of all he's met without losing his Jewish core

## Dialogue Patterns

- **New York Characters**: Ironic, intellectual, distanced
- **Israeli Characters**: Direct, intense, pragmatic
- **Palestinian Characters**: Hospitable, pained, dignified
- **European Characters**: Philosophical, historically conscious
- **Egyptian Characters**: Formal, proud, ancient-minded

## Key Principle

Each character Eden meets is a teacher, even those he disagrees with. They all contribute to his understanding that truth is multifaceted but not relative - there is a light that shines through all authentic seeking.
