## Character Development Notes

- Each character should surprise Eden (and readers) with unexpected depth
- Avoid stereotypes - give each character contradictions and complexity
- Their encounters should leave Eden changed, carrying pieces of each
- Sera is not just romance but represents Eden's capacity for intimacy returning
- The love story with Sera parallels the spiritual journey - as he finds God, he finds love
