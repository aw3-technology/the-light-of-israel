### What These Characters Provide:

3. **Rootedness** - Deep connection to land that parallels Jewish connection
4. **Diversity** - Christian, Muslim, Jerusalem, refugee backgrounds
5. **Agency** - Active characters making choices, not just victims

### What to Avoid:
1. **Tokenism** - Palestinians as props for Eden's journey
2. **False equivalencies** - Not claiming equal suffering or equal blame
3. **Resolution fantasy** - No magical solutions to conflict
4. **Appropriation** - Staying in Eden's perspective, not claiming Palestinian voice
5. **Stereotypes** - Neither all terrorists nor all victims

### Integration Approach:
- **Organic encounters** - Palestinians naturally part of Jerusalem life
- **Respectful distance** - Eden learns from them but doesn't solve for them
- **Parallel narratives** - Similar love for land, different historical experiences
- **Individual stories** - Focus on people, not representatives of people
- **Honest complexity** - Acknowledge conflict without taking political positions
