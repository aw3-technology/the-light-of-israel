## His Role in Ethan's Journey

### Sample Dialogue
> "You think caring about Palestinian kids makes me anti-Semitic? I'm protecting Jewish values from Jewish nationalism!"

> "My grandmother survived Auschwitz so I could have the luxury of criticizing Israel. That's what liberation means."

> "You're romanticizing trauma, Ethan. October 7th doesn't give Israel a blank check for oppression."

> "I don't need a homeland. I need justice. And those aren't the same thing."

## Final Note

Aaron Gold is not Ethan's opposite but his shadow - the path Ethan might have taken without October 7th. His own journey parallels Ethan's: from ideological certainty through identity crisis to complex integration. Their friendship's fracture and healing mirrors the novel's larger themes of exile, wrestling, and return. Aaron represents the possibility that there are many ways to be Jewish, many forms of teshuvah, many lights of Israel burning in diaspora.
