## Her Absence During Eden's Journey
While Eden travels to Greece, Rome, Germany, and Egypt, Sera:
- Continues her work with trauma survivors
- Deepens her own practice
- Holds space for his return
- Represents the home he's seeking

## The Name "Sera"
When others call her Sera, it's casual, everyday. When Eden finally says "Seraphina" - perhaps in a moment of recognition or love - it acknowledges her full being: both the everyday woman and the burning angelic presence she represents in his transformation.

## Core Message Through Her
Love - real love, sacred love - is not separate from spiritual awakening but part of it. Eden cannot truly return to God without returning to his capacity to love and be loved. Sera embodies this truth: that the divine is not abstract but lives in human connection, in the choice to build life together despite the darkness.

## Final Note
Sera is not Eden's salvation - he must save himself. But she is the embodiment of what becomes possible when he does: a life of integrated wholeness, rooted love, and sacred partnership. She is both the promised land and a real woman, both the Shekhinah and Sera who drinks coffee and argues about politics. This duality is her gift to the story.
