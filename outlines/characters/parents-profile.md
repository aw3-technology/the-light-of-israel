## Final Arc
David and Miriam Stone represent the possibility of teshuvah (return) at any age. Their journey from assimilated distance to engaged Judaism parallels Ethan's but at a different pace and style. They show that there are many ways to be Jewish, many ways to return, and that love can bridge even ideological chasms within families.

They don't become religious in orthodox sense, but they become Jewishly engaged - learning Hebrew, attending study sessions, connecting with grandchildren's Jewish identity, and making peace with their own choices while supporting Ethan's different path.

Their arc demonstrates that Ethan's return enables their return, that sometimes children lead parents home, and that Jewish identity is strong enough to survive even generations of well-intentioned neglect.
